"Great Professor with great chemistry knowledge. He makes students get involved and be responsible. His exams are challenging but similar to practice problems. Have no idea how one student graded him so poorly, especially when he/she felt that he/she didn\'t deserve to pass. I\'m taking 229 now and his 219 helps greatly."
This class was a lot of funny. Didn\'t want to take an eng class in college but its required. He makes it interesting. Extremely fair. Great guy
"By far the worst teacher I have ever had in my life. Took every single opportunity to dock down points like it was her only way of feeling powerful in life. Graded unfairly. People with poor papers often got better grades than amazing papers like my own. My amazing papers were never good enough. Final was the only thing she graded well, 100%."
Very difficult to understand
This wasn\'t a bad class. He seems to know what he is talking about. If you are a good reader and dedicated to learning outside the classroom you will do excellent. He spends a lot of time on the important things. For his tests you really have to understand the material or you\'ll do poorly. A very educational course.
"She\'s super sweet! Her class is super easy and you get to use all the notes, that she provides, on each test. There is no way you cannot pass the class, just come for points and the notes and you\'re good. She\'s so amazing and understanding and one off the best professors I have ever had."
"Horrible. She obviously hasn\'t been in the industry for 20+ years, because her examples and projects are dated. You learn nothing about creative, only that she doesn\'t think sex ads are appropriate. You don\'t even use computers. I was looking forward to this class, but with her it was a complete waste of time."
Mebbie was hands down one of the best profs I have ever had. She is sincere and brilliant! She is clear on her expectations and wants you to understand the material. Her lectures are interesting and she encourages you incoporate everyday uses for the material. Fantastic professor and woman!
I took her economics 100 class and it was a very straight forward class. It was pretty slack so I enjoyed it. The prof was a bit unorganized at times but it was an easy credit.
This is an online course with great discussion topics and easy textbook based quizzes once a week. If you are organized it\'s an easy GPA boost.
"VERY EASY, BUT YOU NEED TO GO TO CLASS AND LISTEN. WORK THE PROBLEMS AND MAKE SURE YOU UNDERSTAND AND MOST IMPORTANTLY TAKE GREAT NOTES. OPEN BOOK OPEN NOTE TEST! TAKING HIM AGAIN."
"Doesn\'t seem to enjoy teaching, somewhat rude and disrespectful, doesn\'t explain the material well but discourages questions, does return homework and tests promptly, probably better suited for middle or high school education."
Prof. Magrann was EXTREMELY helpful in making the information interesting and fun for a NON Science major. I would recommend her to any undergrad OR a grad student who needs to pick up this course for their grad studies.
Learned a lot from him. Really nice guy and gives students an opportunity to improve their grade. Very fair professor.
"A horrible teacher, class was not useful for what it was said to do. Never gave marks back, even when asked multiple times. Was very unclear about what was expected, i didn\'t think i signed up for folk dance with no apparent purpose. Not useful at all, prof tried hard, but it just didnt come through."
"Marjorie is probably the best professor ive had in college. She is extremely helpful and if you take her class seriously, and do the work, you will learn a lot. She is also my advisor and gives helpful advice."
His biology class is not hard as long as you take the time to really study enough.
"Great and wonderful professor. She\'s really helpful and answers your questions thoroughly and leading to the right direction. You need to attend class so you can take good notes, listening to her lectures which are taken from her powerpoint slides. She even shows you mini games and examples to help you understand the concepts and topics."
"Dr. Lardner is friendly, helpful, and genuinely wants his students to succeed. He also gives a lot of useful commentary and faciliative feedback with regard to assignments, and he is clearly very knowledgeable of his field. My only concern is that he might go a little too easy on people."
"Well, it wasn\'t easy...but it was calculus. I\'m a straight A student and i would NOT have gotten an A in calculus if anyone else had been teaching it. He is very helpful but you do need to ask questions if you don\'t get it because he will just keep on going. Love the witty tshirts."
This guy was the bomb! Very funny and down to earth. Always mixed up class with some stories. If you want a laid back teacher who did not give a ton of work and you want to learn something take this guy!
"Prof. Pine is easily one of the best professors in the dept. His experiences give him something real to draw on when speaking of programming and the real world. He is difficult, but too many profs coddle you. This is higher education; appreciate someone with standards."
"One of the greatest professors I have ever had throughout my academic journey. The class is by no means a walk in the park. However, she provides study guides and example exams that are similar in structure. Her stuff to know section on the power point slides will prepare you for the exam. You will walk out a genius no lie."
This was my favorite class this semester and made me want to continue in IS. Its nice to have a professor who actually cares and does what he teaches for a living. Project is time consuming but everyone i know in other classes basically does the same (he does take it more seriously). Its easy to get an A by showing up and doing the assignments.
"Her class is fairly easy. Just read the book or use the website and you\'ll do fine. If you have a real interest in Bus definitely take this class with her. Be prepared to do a group project though. Overall-- very good class. Also, if you have concerns about your major and stuff, she\'s very helpful."
"Story-telling is an important skill, and Mr. Garrow is good at it. His phrasing, timing, and message are all pretty strong. Media 105 raised my awareness of the story structures that I can use in my work. I\'m grateful: I need all the help I can get as a technical story-teller. He also made artistic recommendations which I could follow."
"ive never had a more boring class at central then this. maybe its the topic but he is really monotone. almost puts me to sleep. doesnt give clear information for tests or projects. when asked a question, gives a general response which doesnt answer the question at all. stay away for your own sake. i dont want you to have to take this class."
"Dr. Anderson is undoubtedly one of the best professors in the department. I am so grateful that she has brought her intelligence, creativity and scope to UNM from Harvard. Her classes are incredibly well researched, her lectures clear and intentional, and her use of technology is cutting-edge."
"Very knowledgeable, extremely helpful. He makes class interesting and fun. SW Practice is applied to everyday scenerios that you may encounter as a social worker, it makes learning the material fun."
He\'s the best!!
"Her English is awful, and I feel like she doesn\'t even know what she\'s talking about sometimes. She confuses herself and her students. The thing she graded most was a group project with confusing instructions. Nice person. Lectures feel like sitting in a foreign airport for a couple hours."
"Her online summer class is very stressful and hard. It is too much material for each test in the text book, and she does not tell you what to look for, and how to tell if it is relevant. She needs to realize that this is not the only thing that is going on in people\'s lives."
"She was an engaging teacher. Her homework assignments required some work but were not hard. Her tests were also pretty easy. If you have to take this class for your major, I would suggest her."
"I really disliked this professor at first, but I really admire what he is trying to do with the program. I learned a lot, and though I suffered a lot of humiliation, I think perhaps it was worth it."
"Do not take Religion 102 with Ira. There are only 4 poorly worded tests, and that\'s it. You won\'t have any homework other than reading, but the test questions suck. His lectures are not organized, and you won\'t be able to tell what is important. I already know the material, but I didn\'t learn anything from him. Take another professor."
I got an A+ and perfect scores on each assignment. The curve for this course is famous - its worth waiting if you hate bio. She was helpful and pleasant in the lab. No complaints.
great guy
She is VERY confusing. One second she will be talking about one thing and the next she is on to a new subject. Friendly enough though.
"Boman is not a professor that everyone will like. His lectures were too fast paced and often didn\'t teach me anything. However, I learned a lot by asking him questions during and after class, and if you read the book, you\'ll pass easily. His quizzes will often use the same questions from his homework, and some quizzes even repeat the same question."
Lectures were fast-moving but very informative and interesting. Rymph does a great job of connecting the material with past and present day events. The class was challenging but worth it. She gives easy quizzes over assigned books but they are worth the read and relate to class material. Awesome professor!
"Easy, go to class and take all the notes, questions from the test are a combination of the notes and the questions in the book."
"Had Don for Mat+Tech, he speaks a little softly so try to get a seat in the front. For each technique assignment has two practices , but other than that theres no homework. You can put a lot or a little in an assignment, as long as it\'s decently complete by critique. You can resubmit through the quarter as long as you come to critique."
goofy.
"very good teacher, really knows his stuff..it is an overall interesting class, i learned a lot. reading is a given but the are all easy to read and most are interesting. if u read the text, you pass the quiz. 1 essay due."
"As a professor of higher education, Vicki is committed to providig the very best to her students. She\'s helpful, patient, and very comfortable working in different environments wth different types of students. Vicki demonstrates a desie to help EACH of her students and goes out of her way to help on regular basis. Vicki is THE best professor."
I love Jonathan
Very kind professor and wants her students to succeed. Do all of the essays assigned or you won\'t end up with anything higher than a C. She is not an easy grader so definitely take your rough drafts to her to ensure that you can get the highest grade possible! She also expects all work be done on time and gives in class time for essays.
Sam is always willing to answer questions. He only goes fast over the subject if you permit it. He is easy to approach with questions and keeps open office hours for help and uses email. If you are not confident with math 092/098 then of course upper math classes will seem difficult. Work hard and speak up! Sam\'s classes are great!
LOVED her! Sad that this is her last year teaching. Class was interesting and her test weren\'t hard. She was super helpful during office hrs and pretty much told me what I needed to know for test
"Great professor she knows her stuff and is a great professor that is willing to help you out. Visit her in office hours if you are struggling and she will really work until you get it...she made learning spanish fun, challenging, and rewarding all at the same time...hands down best spanish professor."
"Rita is not a very good college professor. We hardly did anything in class and every class discussion was based on politics. She did not communicate very well with students and did not grade things in a timely manner, or even at all."
"Lauren is such a great teacher! she is very helpful and all of her notes follow along with the textbook, making it alot easier to study. Lauren helps you in any way that she can and explains everything for the tests! GREAT TEACHER!"
I am not a Bio major but I will definitely take Chuck in the future for all my Bio classes because he makes it interesting and has a good sense of humor. I don\'t know who gave the bad review but if I was able to do well in the class and become interested then other people should too.
"Wonderful teacher, he knows exactly what he is talking about. I think he is a little bit too nice to disruptive students, but anyway, take his class you will do great. You will have to study but not to hard. I made a B, and didn\'t really study hard at all, those that did made an A."
You definitely need to work in order to pass her class. But if you put in the effort you will end up learning a lot. She took a lot of time crafting her lessons and does a good job engaging us in discussions in class. Will definitely consider taking another one of her classes in the future! Amazing!
"I highly do not recommend taking him ever. He is a nice guy, however if you were good at math in highschool you should know that you will still get a C or lower in his class. His lectures are awful and extremely unclear, he also doesn\'t explain anything during his lectures, he just does problems on the board. Don\'t take if you want a good grade."
"She\'s alright. She is very funny and cares a lot about student\'s grades. If you want to get a good grade go for it but if you wanna learn, I wouldn\'t recommend her."
"She has no idea what she\'s doing. She would give her mid-term then realize it was all wrong,toss our grades, and make us take a new test. It happened with all 3 of our tests. She\'s awful! Take another teacher if you can."
"She\'s a really nice teacher, I just found that she never quite knew what she was talking about when it came to our assignments. As long as you\'re timely about hanging in assignments, as well as follow the guidelines of the assignments, you\'ll pass this class with flying colors."
"Very great teacher and gives some helpful hints for tests. Anyone unfamiliar with Excel, PowerPoint, and Access would eventually benefit from him. Tests are 10+ questions and they are easy. Gives full attention to students in need of help. Lets people out early if they are finished with the work. Would take him again if I could. very Helpful"
"You will be graded strictly on multiple choice tests that he gives you the answers to and announces what will be on the test. Very easy going professor, Show up to class, study !!! test are only 25 questions, you will enjoy taking this man."
good
I really liked him. He made me want to switch to a psychology degree!!
"At first, he seems unbearable and exceedingly rude. However, with enough work, it is possible to get out alive! I do not recommend taking his class at all. If you don\'t finish the lab within the required time, he will not allow extra time to finish."
"great guy, best prof in the program"
"Extremely liberal, almost socialist. Your grade will depend on how much he likes you, not your quality of work. Easy, but a waste of time."
"I got an A in this class which is a miracle since I was about to walk out in the middle of the semester. She hates students and hates being there. I attended one of her evening classes and most of us were very motivated, quiet and eager to learn yet she was visibly upset with us several times for no reason. Students are not your enemies!"
Class is hard to stay awake in. Make sure you revisit the material many times because you will not understand it just by going to lecture.
Fair .. good teacher
"Excellent professor, knows his**** inside and out, you will learn alot and you will work for the grade you earn, but if you want to learn, take him!"
"She seems like a really intelligent person, but as a professor, she isn\'t very good at all. To be honest, one of the worst I\'ve had at NU so far. The class was extremely easy and I hardly learned anything. She would talk about things not related to the course and she would always forget what she was saying. She drove me crazy!"
Lisa is an amazing professor. I am lucky to have had her as a professor. She goes above and beyond! Many thanks!
"Good guy, covers a lot of material I had never been exposed to before. Must take his class! Great smile LOL"
"He is one of the most intelligent business professors on campus. He is willing to help anyone who asks. He is funny and nice and one of my favorite teachers. Take notes, pay attention and read the book and you are golden!"
"I took 5 of his classes. He rules. Very fun guy to know. His classes are sometimes kinda tough, but they\'re all very interesting and very informative, and he does an amazing job presenting the information. Loves to stay away from lecturing all the time. Definitely take one of his classes if you can."
"Took class online. We have not received any grades throughout the whole course - class has ended on Aug. 8, 2012 -- and still no final grade. Left all of the class hanging, unprofessional in that aspect only."
"She is a very intelligent professor, she knows the subject matter and is passionate about what she teaches. The course load was manageable, and she was always willing to look over a draft if you needed help with something. Gave detailed comments on paper, which were very helpful. Overall very good professor."
"Tamara is a wonderful professor. She is highly engaging, very supportive, and is delightfully genuine. I learned so, so much from her. Take a course with her!"
Lots of work!!!
This class is definitely not a class i look foward to. it is very hard to pay attention in this class because he is very boring and bad at communicating. This class is no BUENO!
"She is amazing. Love, love, love her. In and out of class, loved going to Suds with her, and she helped out in some extra activities: aka periodic table of dance."
"Sims is a rather quirky, likable professor. He was helpful and wanted students to achieve. Willing to work with students to accomplish goals. I would definitely take another class with him."
Best professor I had by far. Definitely knows his stuff. Really gets into it and gives amazing lectures! He is very knowledgeable and helpful. Not much homework. He goes over notes and test notes. Really makes sure you understand everything. Final exam is just a regular test not over all the chapters. Tends to put a curbs in tests. TAKE CLASS!
"She\'s cool. I took her for Race & Ethnicity. She\'s a fair grader. Some of the stuff she assigns is easy, and some of it is harder. Doesn\'t give much tests other than a midterm & final. I\'m taking her for Classical Theory. In both classes, she makes you buy the books. Some of the readings (Marx) are available online. She doesn\'t use blackboard."
"tough grader. the class is writing intensive so be ready for lots of quizzes, homework, assignments, online discussion, before class quizzes. so much to cover in his class. by the time you realize whether you can handle his class it would be too late because he takes late his first test."
She\'s great!
"Eric is an amazing professor who meets the levels of all of his students. He works with those who don\'t excel in drawing and grades according to how well you execute or put time into you work. He also pushes those who do have a knack for drawing. Great for getting ideas, cares about his students. Amazing professor! I would take him again for sure!"
"no one in class recieved an A, 2 Bs, the rest C or lower"
"Took his online english 101. Very fast pace, used slang lingo to describe items. Has you perform internet searches that takes hours when he should have place hyperlinks for students Lots of wasted time. People seem to think highly of him but I would avoid his classes. Very harsh on his grading, my best grade was an eighty-three, BS Grade."
She is very fair allows more than enough time for you to be successful in her class on line. Makes the work clear and understandable as an older student I appreciate her very much
So easy. Always lets out early. Gets right down to what you need to know and ALWAYS gives the questions to the 40 pt essays at least a week before the test. NO FINAL. Take her. Now.
"There was never any point in going to lectures, all he does is read from the slides. Homework matters, doesn\'t have anything to do with his slides. The TA\'s do the brunt of the work and he is literally going to try his best to NOT help you outside of class. You can email him, you may or may not get a response and its probably not a helpful response"
This was her first semester teaching. I had her for Biology of Human Reproduction and she\'s a great teacher. She\'s young and fun and knows what she\'s talking about. I highly recommend you take this class from her for a science credit!
"Lundak is a nice old man. He tries to be funny, but isn\'t. He\'ll go on and on in class and you\'ll hate it, but you can just be on your computer doing whatever and he doesn\'t care. Tests are somewhat hard, everything else is fairly easy. Nice guy, didn\'t learn a whole lot from him though. Better than Shumacher."
If he gives you an A your the only one.
Danny if you\'re reading this! You\'re great! Taking your class again.
He was very helpful. I never had a problem with him and ended up with descent marks. I donno why I see so many negative feedback for him. Recommended.
"This Professor was amazing! Took her 8 week course Spring \'18 and couldn\'t be more grateful for her, and this website! This teacher is amazing anyone who doesn\'t Ace this class just did\'t try. 3 speeches and 1 HW assignment! Attendance counts!!"
You get out what you put in I learned A LOT! It is an easy class he helps you. He has a ton to say!
Excellent teacher and VERY enthusiastic. She is always willing to take time to help each student.
"Dr. K provides an opportunity for up to 10 bonus points on every exam except the final, which is basically a built in curve. The class is very hard and requires lots of time outside of class for homework, lecture review, and reading. I have taken her for two classes and her grading is very fair."
"He has to be one of the best Politcal Geographer\'s in the country, this man is just an awesome presence. What I\'ve learned in his class has allowed me to make friends and travel all over the world (except East Asia, as I have no interest). I can connect wi"
"This professor is much better than a lot of the other professor from what I\'ve heard. Course structure consists of group projects, participation, midterm/final (multiple choice and true/false). Overall, I would recommend taking this class with Professor Ling. However, don\'t think there\'s much use in the class itself (management/marketing class)."
"Mylander is hands down the best professor I\'ve had at State (and I\'ve had some great ones). She is EXTREMELY intelligent and really knows what she\'s talking about. Great lectures, gives lots of historical context crucial to understanding the text. Super helpful in office hours. She will make you a better writer. Did I mention she\'s gorgeous?"
"He is a professor not focusing on the teaching. In class, he had a lot of general principles of being a good student including his own experience. But you can learn nothing from his personal experience which he was proud about."
"Professor Gilchrist is an amazing teacher, but he is hard to impress. He knows exactly want he wants and doesn\'t give out many As in class. That said, he challenges your thinking and processes in a good way. You may have to bust your butt to keep up with the deadlines and requirements, but its worth what you get out of the class in the end."
"More concerned about her appearance then students, poor teaching style. All about her!"
I don\'t know why there are so many Dmytro haters. He is the man.
"Physiology isnt an easy class in general but it is do-able, in order to make a good grade in there you have to come to class. Her notes are sometimes hard to follow but she is always willing to help if you come by her office. I suggest rewriting the notes and using notecards when studying."
"She\'s the best English teacher I\'ve had at El Camino.Her class was fun. Assigments were short and had good variety. However, it was very fast paced with a high amount of group work and a lot of trips to the computer lab. Word of advice, take care of your own grade and speak up or your group could cost you some points."
"MAC always goes above and beyond in all of his classes. He teaches the material with real life applications. He teaches in a unique style that works exceptionally for him. In addition, he is always a helping hand for life situations, and is a fair teacher and grader. Mac also has over 2 decades experience which is awesome."
"Mr. O, is a great, great math teacher. Makes you take notes so that you can understand completely and then go back as needed. Very helpful and super nice guy. I would definenately take him again for any Math that he teaches."
"Very laid back professor. Has real life experience and knows the material in task. Although he\'ll ramble off topic easily at times, he stresses that no one will get lower than a B in the class. Very easy class with a very easy professor."
"Challenges the student to learn the material. Very well informed, with clear informative PowerPoint presentations. Makes sure everyone is following. Very encouraging and diplomatic."
"Had him for Sports Entrepreneurship class Fall 2015, such an awesome professor. Questions on tests are straight from material you cover in class. Had some great guest speakers come in to speak to our class. And he will help you however he can if you speak up and ask for it. I\'m on pace for a B+/A- in class"
"LOVE LOVE LOOOVE her!!! Seriously I am absolutely horrible at math & her trig class was so easy for me! She is hilarious and makes sure you know what you\'re doing. Notes on EVERY test (even the final) & you get an extra 100 if you attend everyday! Easiest class I had, for sure! Take her!!!"
Mr. Mahfoudi is super nice and funny. He makes learning French easy.
Repetitive notes along with lectures that have no point. She is a very headstrong person so don\'t even bother bringing your own opinion to class. And her only grade she gives out is a C. I defiantly would not recommend her to anyone.
He is one of the most interesting teachers I have ever had. He keeps his lectures interesting and intellectual. AWESOME!
Just had our exams. I would nooot have passed without Prof. Gupta. CS is not my main area and most of the other people in class had a lot more coding experience so I was playing catch-up a lot of the time. He took a lot of time out and went over all the material with me in the weeks before the second quiz and final and really boosted my confidence.
"Material was actually slightly interesting, and it would have been a good class if professor kliger wasn\'t the worst professor ever. Bad jokes, runs OVERTIME on a 3 and a half hour long class, ridiculous grading -- Rutgers needs to step in and take action"
"Awesome! Best presentation of history I\'ve encountered, ever. Took three courses with Dr. Bach, all three were absolutely captivating - the amount of information, detailed reviews of every assigned book, the little known circumstantial facts surrounding historical events I learned from him - I\'d gladly pay out of pocket to work with him in future!"
Great class!
If you want an A take a course from her. fun and a easy maker but very nice
"Took the flex term, only 8 weeks. No textbook purchase required. He starts off every morning with an inspirational quote. You\'ll keep exercise logs each week. Super easy class! Easy A, just do the assignments and turn them in on time. I would definitely take him again!! You can tell he really enjoys his job!"
"She is a hard grader, and she is very specific on quizzes, but you can up your grade by the weekly assignments she assigns which usually involve short essays. Overall not an easy class!"
"the greatest professor I have had to date. wonderfl woman, both as a person and as an educator. just a beautiful human being, and I have never seen such a passionate instructor. the class is a must take, too."
Best professor I\'ve ever had.
Quite honestly the worst professor I have taken thus far in my college career and I\'ve had my share of poor professors. Can\'t form a proper sentence in emails and refuses to email me back anything of value. Don\'t waste your time or money.
"Sean is one of the best professors at ElCo. He assigns really interesting short stories and allows total freedom in your essays. I cant say enough good things about him but he definitely is on your side 100%. Hes approachable and super helpful, will break anything down if you\'re having trouble. Really really chill person. Take him!"
"she is the best, please take, exams and tests are easy, she gives reviews for all exams"
Look\'s like the last guy is being vindictive. I just finished having the class with Deb and if you do your part - you\'ll get a good mark. She provides tons of time and extra materials. Thanks Deb!
"I thougt that the comments were over exaggerated, no. Great presenter. Gives good information. You have to study so hard to at least pass. He offers help, but his ""kindness"" made me feel dumb. This class made me doubt myself. Miss a day, forget about it, nice knowing you. Have I expressed how hard of a grader he is? Yeah. I was once warned..."
"Really enjoyable class. Took as gen-ed for science but gained an appreciation for geography. The week of an exam you might have some extra work but other than that, very little homework outside of class. For exams MEMORIZE THE NOTES. Just put them in quizlet, it won\'t take long and if you\'ve gone to every lecture and took good notes, you\'ll be fine"
She doesnt keep students informed on anything. Papers are hard but she grades very easy. The hardest part is remembering due dates.
"This course is writing intensive but if you check in a few times a week and don\'t procrastinate, you\'ll be fine. She gives plenty of time for assignments to be done."
If you want to learn about accounting and its impact on business take this class! He is able to relate technical material to the real world.
"I took Proff. Ruiz for my English 28 class and I do not regret my decision. He is very clear on his expectations and how he will help his students improve on their reading and writing skills to prepare us for 101. Yes, there is a lot of reading but it helps the students improve and build. He is very funny and cares for his students. Recommend him."
"professor is very monotonous, and unkempt. He speaks in circles and with redundancy, while not even speaking about a point. He makes pointless refrences to abstract topics. Also, I filled my ""I give a sh*t"" bottle with 2 monsters and waited till class to drink them. I still fell asleep"
"very nice, very engaging, and truly loves her job. 4 hw assignments, 3 projects, 1 midterm, 1 final, a few pop quizzes with an iclicker. everything is super easy if you follow her directions very closely and do her study guides. go to her office hours if you need help. she is an awesome person overall and will back you up if you need it. recommend!"
"I love Dr. Vogel! Her class requires quite a bit of time and work, but she\'s willing to help and explain things that you don\'t understand. She\'s good about checking/replying to emails, and she\'s always willing to meet face-to-face. She usually goes by her schedule and always let us know when making changes to it. Taking her again this semester!"
Online course no teaching done. Very unreasonable prof. Will try to avoid in future.
"She was an okay professor. Not really the clearest lecturer. I didn\'t feel very prepared for the tests. Basically, she wasn\'t horrible, but physics could have been better."
"I took this class online. There wasn\'t much work to do, but he didn\'t pay much attention to the class. When emailed, he didn\'t get on until nearly a week later to even ready it. He doesn\'t follow the syllabus, confuses you and is never on to clear up the situation. Overall the class was easy, but stressful."
"lilienthal is just a really good teacher. Doesn\'t just regurgitate the textbook, but gives real life examples of stuff in the book. She has actually worked in real life and has been at a bunch of top schools. Has pretty much taught all over the world."
A very helpful professor. Her teaching style is very unique and always keeps the classes interesting. I would highly recommend this professor.
I was very happy with the course and the professor. He has been very helpful with the HW assignments. No change in the course content is needed.
"I would tell anyone to take his class, yea, people say he looks moody, but it\'s funny. He\'s a funny guy, always helpful. This was definitely my best class of freshman year. THIS GUY IS THE MAN!"
"One of the most intelligent people I know. In EVERY area. A true Renaissance man. Very helpful inside and outside of class. Great sense of humor. And come on, you gotta love the elbow patches!"
"An outstanding teacher, Dr. Edmunds is very precise in his explanations of technical materials. His lectures are presented in a clear and interesting style. This course is a mixture of lectures and hands on labs. Sporadically giant rabbits may interfer"
He\'s the lab instructor for introduction to archaeology. makes boring labs as fun as possible. willing to help if you don\'t get it or miss class. signing up for the labs is optional
"wow, appel was horrible. he would change his mind on projects about 3 days before, and he would never give clear and concise answers on anything. he walks into teach, but it is obvious he has no plans and is unorganized."
"Really nice lady and passionate about math, not to mention she gives chocolate and tells lame jokes. I have heard she is usually great but had an off semester. Lectures were mostly conceptual rather than actually working problems out. Tests were HARD and her class/homework didn\'t prepare you for them. Put hours of work into class, barely passed."
"You wont learn to much, but most likely you will get a C or higher."
"This teacher is so great.I can learn a lot from her class.she did a lot of work for her class. the test is not hard if you study well. I hope she can teach Eng113, but she can\'t. I strongly recommend her class because it really help your English."
Hard Prof. but really cares if you do well. Work hard and it\'ll be fine.
"Extremely dull and dry. He should retire asap because he lost my essay! Lucky for him, I still have my copy, now i have to wait for another week or month to find out what is my overall mark in this course. . Not impressed at all."
"somewhat interesting prof but does go off subject sometimes. he tag teamed with Kneller on this class, Smith\'s lectures were more interesting but his tests were harder for me than Kneller\'s. if you actually go to class and take a few notes then study the power points online in addition to following directions for the ""internet"" assignments easy."
"Sodan is a great professor once students get to know him (more friendly after 2 or 3 classes). Class was mostly easy, do the job, listen to what he says, and you\'ll pass the class with a good grade."
I must say this class is extremely hard and he expects way too much for a 2 hour class. I ended up with a B+ but I got lucky on a lot of test questions. His book is absolute crap which he tries to sell off as the bible of programming. Also MATLAB itself just isn\'t that good. If you dont have to take it don\'t if u do just show up EVERY SINGLE DAY!
"The labs are ridiculously long. Avoid this class if not required for your major. But Ball is extremely helpful. A little saltly in re-grade hours, but really helpful in normal office hours. Lectures are helpful if you don\'t know about the chem from the 6 series. If you take this class, go to office hours for help with labs if you need it!!!!"
Amanda is awesome! Easiest class ever. You always get out early. Easy grader. She\'s fun and has good stories. Weekly journals that are super easy. Definately take her class!
High work load but very good teacher. He has a great grading system. Do the work and you will do fine. Good classroom atmosphere.
"Even though he has a thick accent,i think he is a good instructor and is very knowledgeable on the subject"
"AVOID HIM!! He had his favorites and totally screwed everyone else. He is completely subjective in his grading. I went to every painful class and participated every day, and STILL got under 50% for participation. Misery."
Professor Lipkin is a very good professor. Gives excellent feedback on research papers. He\'s clear and to the point. Responds very fast to any questions.
"Good teacher if you\'re looking for a good grade. Not very clear on some material, and the notes in class are very random, however the study guides make up for this because they match the tests."
"be prepared to study this is not an easy A. teacher is very fair, informative, and willing to help, if you are willing to put in the work."
She was such a sweetheart! Nothing bad about her! This class is such an easy A as long as you do the work. She is not a tough grader and she gives a ton of extra credit opportunities.
Very Demeaning. Students are afraid to talk in her class because she always has to put in her two cents.
Great class; just wish there could be more added to the program to make it a 3 credit course. There was a lot of information that could have been elaborated on to give internet research a more broader perspective.
do not under any circumstances take any of this teacher\'s classes. She is sarcastic and uninteresting. Her classes her boring and you will will dread going to them. You\'ve been warned!!!!
Great teacher..fun and the class isn\'t that difficult. You should pay attention but he makes it easy.
"He teaches online stats math 1342, he is awesome. He emails almost everyday with cool things in the news related to stats, all exams online taken from home. His exams are just like his reviews. He is one of the better teachers I\'ve had. He communicates all the time, others I had never did this. He also has a good sense of humor."
"Lab was super easy because she makes sure we understand how to do everything. She was also my recitation prof, she came in at like almost the end of the semester and trust me, my grades went up by A LOT!!! Definitely take her and make sure to pay attention, bc if you do, you\'re all set!"
"She is a horrible techer VERY condescending, never listens to her students, and rude. She was constantly either late or didnt show up at all. Her tests are extremely difficult. Unless you are a glutton for punishment and you have no desire to pass the class, then have her for a teacher. Otherwise, stay clear of her"
"Pretty leniant for Humanities courses. Good teaching style, but antagonistic with students who disagree and don\'t support their arguments."
"This profesora is muy bien. Seriously though, you will not find a better Spanish teacher anywhere. She is kind, understanding, and speaks clearly. Her methods reach all types: from singer types to visual types. She helps you learn, and does not give up; this allows students to get excellent grades--as long as you don\'t mind a towering teacher (6\'6)"
"Prof. Perret was a very influential and great educator. And just to clear things up, I am not Prof. Perret and think it is unacceptable to bash a proffesor on this website. For ppl who have to take geog 100, take him. Yes its challenging sometimes but u will learn a lot. The class consist of quizzes, a midterm and final. I really enjoyed the class"
"Dr. Darken made me a better mathematician. She is quirky, her tests are tough, and if you want an A you have to work hard for it. COME TO CLASS. Cons: she picks on people to answer questions, and she grades meticulously. Ex. She counts off .5 pt if you use instead of an approximate sign. Her tests are 2 parts: Calculator & No Calculator."
Wonderful teacher. Very informative and makes the class very interesting. This class is easy if you pay attention and do the work. And she is willing to help all the time. Understandable but will not let you take advantage of her politeness. Recommended class!
"The people complaining about him are also the same people who take him too seriously. He is incredibly consistent, and at times his quirkiness borders on the strange, but he is a VERY GOOD professor. You will learn the material if you pay attention. Additionally, he is highly entertaining if you learn to appreciate his mannerisms/being. Take him."
"I had the hardest time in her class, I would study and put in so much effort and still would get Bs, and I\'m an A student. Toward the end I finally understood her teaching style and did better and ended up with an A. Basically, read the book, watch YouTube videos, and teach yourself or take someone else."
Super easy! She is a sweet lady and as long as you turn in your work you will have an A. The slackers get B\'s and the morons get C\'s. Take her if you want to boost your GPA.
"He\'s enthusiastic about course material and loves to help students! He\'s very caring and wants students to do well. His tests are fair so don\'t underestimate what you need to know. Honestly, he makes lectures fun to attend :)"
"The topics are easy, but it is alot of work. It\'s a summer school course so you basically have a paper every week. But so long as you do the work and watch the films, its amazing. I totally recommend it!"
"He\'s a nice guy, and enthusiastic about the subject, but he doesn\'t actually teach the class. Your recitation instructor will grade all of your assignments and answer all of your questions. Even in the lecture, he probably only gives every third or fourth lecture (and there\'s only 10 in the term). He\'s essentially useless (not a bad guy thought)."
"She is very knowledgeable, but can be rather dry and booring. Dr. Peterson loves Power Point, and I find that she reads the entire thing to make the entire lecture worthless to show up to. She is very helpful and will do what she can to make sure everyone passes. I think I might have gotten bored, because of her lack of interaction during class."
Such an AWESOME teacher. Had no previous interest N this subject & by end of semester i LOVED this class. VERY LIVELY he encourages class discussion/debate -> good. topics ALWAYS interesting. he\'s also very clear. his tests are fair and well constructed. He does grades hard h/e and he does not provide any comments as to how to improve the essays.
"Good stuff. He gives some real gold nuggets. He told us a story/ he was clerking in Austin when Kennedy was shot. come on, you can\'t beat stuff like that."
"Sweet lady in general, but she expects you to dedicate your life to this class. You will always feel behind. Takes FOREVER to grade assignments so you could be failing and not even know it. Just took the first exam and it\'s been 2 weeks, no grade. This class completely ruins my mood for the day. Make sure she knows you.. that\'s your best bet."
worst teacher ever! really nice lady but doesn\'t know how to teach! makes the class so much harder.
"Dr. Robinson is the worst teacher ever. She does not go by her syllabus and if you have a question she will not answer it and tells you to look in the syllabus or modules. She is not a fair grader at all, her opinions are terrible. I felt that from the feedback she gave from speeches that she was not even watching my presentation. Don\'t recommend!"
Great stories but lots of bragging! Watch out for is his grading. He states in the beginning that he wants to give everyone A\'s but he doesn\'t. I calculated my grade based on his green sheet & I should have gotten an A but he gave me a B+. WTF!
"Racine is honestly the best professor ever. She literally makes every lecture interesting, she is so approachable and is really easy to talk to. She is not intimidating and she is really helpful. Probably one of my ultimate favourite profs at this school."
"Dr. McGhee was an excellent professor. One thing he did that was fun and helpful come test time, was he let his students play the characters role in the story up at the front of the class. If you read the story you would do fine, but if you didn\'t let\'s just say it could be embarrassing for ya."
Best professor Ive ever had. Will take her again in spring! Shes great!
"Class material isn\'t terribly difficut, methods of teaching are sub-par. Ability to clearly explain material to students is terrible at best."
"All she does is stand up there and talk about how liberal she is and how much she hates Trump. When she does try to ""teach"" she just reads straight off the slides. She never announces due dates, assignments are very unclear, and nobody ever knows whats going on in class. You\'d think since she\'s a comm teacher she would know how to communicate!!"
Storrie often gets side tracked with her examples and confuses students. Her policies ambiguous but fair. She will randomly add tiny bits of information that somehow show up on an exam. GOOD THINGS: she allows a formula sheet.
"Take this class, its very easy, i did the minimum and got an, A. Mark is the man and he keeps class very interesting."
JP is an extremely nice person. He is very passionate about his area of expertise.
"This was not an easy course. But it was very good, I learned a lot and the professor was excellent."
"i am in the \'motion graphics\' class now and find him very disorganized, i cant recommend him as a teacher."
Do not take him...he is awful...really bad...I studied do hard ..he is so rude..so uncaring..tell us to shut up and tells us we have no common sense...just take Dr. conolly..he is the best
"Ricardo is one of the most outstanding professors at UBCO. He cares about his students\' educational experience and rewards the process of learning. He teaches his classes how to think critically- his lecture style contributes to this: some don\'t appreciate it, but I find it effective. His classes will challenge what you thought you knew! take him!"
does not teach the material at all and expects students to know how to do it.
"Great teacher, loves class discussion and values individual input--writing assignments are framed very loosely to allow students to use their creativity."
I took three classes with him in one semester. He\'s very passionate about music and very talented. Show up to the test reviews and take notes and you\'ll pass the quizzes. Event critiques are super easy. Overall pretty easy.
She has 0 compassion whatsoever!
Mo is not very organized and goes off topic very quickly in class. No structure to his lectures. Very easy to lose track of things. Not very good at explaining things. He\'s not very helpful in accommodating students registered with AAS. easy class is you have experience w/ French. Participate in class and you\'ll be fine.
An amazing teacher! He is incredibly intelligent and extremely personable.
"Sra. Romo is probably the most caring professor I\'ve had. She truly cares about you and your success in the class and in Spanish in general. Her class isn\'t easy by any means, but if you want to learn, like actually learn Spanish and enjoy it, take her, she\'s the best!!!"
"he\'s hard, no doubt about it.. textbook usage in class is low, but u gotta make sure you study the book on ur own.. I know this cuz i had to work my ass off to get an A in this class (payd off). He\'s usually boring.. basically, you are on your own in this class.."
"Ok, so he\'s not a full-time teacher, but he rocks my socks. Definitely one of the most helpful and laidback teachers I\'ve ever had."
"Dr. Mazidji is a good prof. PROS: He explained things well, he wasn\'t boring, and he\'s kind of funny, and he\'ll help you after class if you have questions. He answered some questions I had about finding jobs in science professions. CONS: A lot of other people didn\'t like him because he pulled a lot of test questions from specifics in the book that he didn\'t cover much in lecture, and his lab period was pretty unorganized. You have to read all the chapters. You can\'t expect to coast through his class."
"She cares a lot about whether or not people agree with her opinion. And if people don\'t, she doesn\'t grade fairly. Not much else to say. Definitely not the best honors prof out there. Avoid if you can"
"Take this professor for engl 12. The class is pretty easy, theres kind of a lot of writing but I think all engl 12 are like that, but he realy helps you with your writing and its not hard to get a good grade! plus he\'s really nice."
"He is terrific. He is helpful with projects. He really wants to make sure that you understand. The first quiz was hard, so pay attention to the details in class. You will learn a lot in this class!"
"He is super cute! Has a very good teaching style, does a lot of examples and has very fair exams! Make sure to use the study guide, its reflects whats on the exams perfectly!"
This class was awful. I dreaded having to listen to her go on and on about her cats and use the same 3 examples for the whole semester. Her voice is also worse than nails on a chalkboard. Not helpful with your GB project as she will ask for something and then ask why you didnt do the exact opposite. Avoid if you can!!!
"She\'s a very nice lady and the class is really easy. There is a journal that she doesn\'t read, but she does count your entries. There were 3 essays and a research paper. She only gave us 2 quizzes. She is really boring though. I had to fight off sleep, but it was worth the easy A I got."
"Kelleher was a really great professor but expects a lot from her students. She knows her stuff though, and her feedback on writing is very helpful. Loved the class."
"He\'s fun to watch in class...keeps his class interested and he\'s really into Quebec, but he\'s THE DEVIL when it comes to marking assignments."
"Patrick was a very nice guy, had printed notes at each class that were complete (no textbook referring needed). His notes were clear, but a little too wordy. What he wrote was very understandable and readable, and explained concepts and facts well. One bad thing is that his exam Q\'s were a bit much (focused on random details that weren\'t expected)."
Robert loves his students and will do anything you ask. Sometimes his assignments are a bit vague as the other rating stated but just ask him and he\'ll help you in anyway you can. He\'s a great person and be sure to harass him about anything.
"Absolutely adore her. A lot of reading (which you\'re expected to do), and she is pretty strict about deadlines, but that is just for consistency. Fair grader, really cares about her students. Went and talked to her when I was feeling overwhelmed by all my work, she was really kind and understnading. This class requires time and effort, but worth it"
He is one professor who doesn\'t really care about students. He thinks about himself as a scientist but hardly have the capabilities of a one. He discusses something else and puts totally different stuff on exams. If you struggle in class then he is going to give you more hard time. He conducts review before exams which have no significance.
AWFUL! all you will do is collage and talk about feelings with people you dont know. goodness. i will not ever take a class from her again. shes very unclear about assignments and will never give you a straight answer. STAY AWAY!
"Ti is great whether you\'re interested in italian or just trying to get rid of a requirement. His classes are fun and he\'ll meet with you any time to cover a lecture (even if you just skipped) He\'s really knowledgable, but not very tough about sticking to the syllabus. Feel free to ask questions. If you do any work you\'ll do well"
Doesn\'t test on what he talks about. Not a fun class by any means.
"She expected way too much for a remedial class. She is very smart, but full of herself."
"Grading: 1. attendance (you must be there every class) 2. weekly quizzes 3. two 4-5 pg papers(that\'s the midterm/final) Hints on Passing: *take good notes bc the slides only have pics *show up to class on time *do the readings (there are lot!) Arthurs makes you earn the grade, but he is an amazing professor who makes HIST interesting. TAKE HIM!"
Her class is really easy if you just do the lecture outlines. Her quizzes might be a little hard if you don\'t prepare for it like i did but i got a 20/25 avg overall.
DONT TAKE HIM! most pointless class ever and has nothing to base his grades on. should be an environmental teacher not a business one
I know more about his daughters then I do about psychology...
Taking him for CIS-107...We never opened the book once so do not buy it (just buy the code off the website). He doesn\'t really have to teach (all internet based) but he\'s very helpful if needed. Do the work he assigns in class and the tests will be easy...Very easy A for those looking to boost GPA
"I hate this class. She gives SO many readings and stupid assignments for homework every single day, and the topics for the papers are dumb. She makes you bring all your books to class and gives pop quizzes over the readigs. She is unenthusiastic and does not make the class interesting."
"MAC2233: His lectures are concise and clear. Works a lot of problems on the board and lets students work on problems in class. I learnt a lot about calculus in this class. Would like him to include more applications, though. Exams are easy if you follow the stuff done in class. very helpful guy."
Dr. Duffy makes this required nightmare of a class bearable with interesting interpretations of the curriculum and the integration of multimedia elements into every class.
He\'s a great guy and a great teacher. Clear on what he is looking for in quizzes and papers. Always makes class interesting no matter the topic. Class discussions are a big part of the class and he accepts all opinions and viewpoints. Subject material is very interesting and covers topics one would normally may never learn about.
Given the chance I would never take this LBST again. I found the teacher to be extremely opinionated and biased. If you enjoy being assigned a novel or long article to read every week then this class is for you. We were required to write a lot in this class and many times she would make us write two different papers on the same topic.
Just two speeches. He is extremely intelligent and seems to know a little about everything. It\'s an easy O credit but his lectures were super boring to me bc I had no idea what he was talking about. It\'s like he assumes everyone have a certain background. I learned nothing but perhaps got some practice with speeches.
"Tom Good is one of the best teachers here. He knows how to get the class involved, and makes the time pass fast (especially for a 4 hour lab class). I wish I had known about him before my last semester, i would have taken him any chance i could! A++++"
Waste of time.
"No idea how she marks and gives out grades like 13.2315. Needs to lecture at a reasonable pace. also doesn\'t give out worksheets for students that could not make it to class. Doest give out solutions to review booklets. Save your money and time take cost accounting with someone else. only way to lean, textbook."
"Professor Werner is the best teacher I have had. His intelligent approach to education makes it easy to both understand and remember the material. Love his ""non-prussian"" attitude toward grading. He gives take-homes and lets you do extra credit work to make up for losses so if you do the work he is not stingy with the A\'s. He\'s the VERY BEST HERE!!"
"An excellent teacher. Usually conducts online courses. Very prompt with answers to questions and very knowledgeable. Very understanding, helpful and easy going."
"Awesome teacher! Definitely take him if you have a chance. Gives tests back in a timely manner, explains things well, and grades very fairly!"
"She was great1 Helpful, easy, understanding. She made it interesting, I wish more teachers were like her. You need the book some of the time."
"She hardly ever shows up for class, and when she does, she doesn\'t teach us anything worth knowing. Tests are nearly impossible when she never taught anything to begin with. She has completely turned me off from film art. Horrible professor. Do not take her class!!!!!!!"
"Professor Ceurstemont is the best. He\'s approachable, caring, and understanding. He always made sure students understood the assignments and exams and was a very fair grader."
"It\'s unfortunate that this is his last year teaching because I enjoyed his class. I think he got negative reviews due to people coming to his art class thinking that it would be an easy ""A"" Art takes time and energy, especially in a technical class. He was helpful and I learned a lot. If you asked him an art related question he was eager help."
"INF120 was the class I took. This is a very hard class. Dr. Kirby is very intelligent and I think it is hard for him to teach a intro class. He probably should not teach intro class, he said on the first day that this class is for people with no programming experience and I had some experience and still struggled..."
"The tests are easy if you\'re listening to the lectures in class. The only difficult thing throughout the whole semester is the song project, but he gives you plenty of time to do it and it is a no-brainer if you have a pair of ears and a brain. One music concert is required, which might get fairly pricey."
"easy class anyway, but she\'s very nice. says hi to you outside of class."
He is a really NICE guy and VERY HELPFUL when you need it! The class is challenging. It is hard to get an A in the class but relatively easy to get a B! The paper helps your grade out ALOT so try not to put it off.
"Great teacher, gives the best examples. Very helpful, in class and outside. He knows what he is talking about. Wont find a better teacher."
easy to get an A. she explains well and is very helpful.
"This was the most difficult course I have taken so far, but also the most enjoyable."
"survey course, etc.if you actually like art history, good professor to take, exam\'s are fair,s tudy abour 25-40 images, only get tested on about 8, biut gives you all info beforehand no surpriss. papers however, extremely difficult grader, watch your grammar or he\'ll rip you apart and call you an idiot.needs to stop wearing striped shirts."
He is a fair man and very knowledgeable
"Peter is very interested in what he teaches. And you\'ll learn a lot about the forefathers of photography. You\'ll take lots of notes, do a paper or two each semester, and take a midterm and final that you do very well on if you study your notes. Very easy class, there\'s no homework besides those papers"
Rude and demanding. Turned me totally off of Econ. Seemed impossible to impress.
"Very easy, interesting and fun class. Best reviews, if you don\'t get an A in her class then ........? And she\'s good looking and young.In One word the class is EASY"
Prof. Agocs is fantastic. His lectures are interesting and he has a great German accent! I highly recommend him for any class that he teaches.
ok so C in the lab A in the lecture. Suggestion: go to the systematics lectures. Her internet notes aren\'t good enough to get you above a B+ on the tests.
He is a great teacher and does everything he can to make everyone succeed. Makes class a lot of fun. If you take Bio 14 from Larson you go on some fun exciting field trips.
i loved this class. abram is very enthusiastic and excellent at teaching this subject. i learned SO much about art history. shes a very fair teacher. in the afternoon it can be hard to sit for an hour in the dark because you can get sleepy but her tests are very easy IF you study/elaborate. take her!!
Awesome class... he definitely made a night class less miserable. Tests and stuff were pretty easy. Definitely take this guy if you get the chance.
"Idk why these other comments say he is hard. He is hard to understand but if you can get past the accent he is an easy teacher. Never used book & uses examples so you understand. Don\'t sit in front, he will call on you the most. Gives 4 quizzes & turns them into 1 test grade, all easy. Come to class & take good notes!"
Does anyone else know what he is trying to say? If so please let me know...
very good instructor
"Jeremy is a great professor, he makes it so you want to attend class. I was terrified at the thought of speech class but Jeremy made me very comfortable. I would recommend him to anyone for any class. This was his first time teaching the class that I was in but did a great job."
"Of course, all professors do is lecture... never felt I learned anything from him."
"Great professor, the class time ended with time to do classwork. The beginning of class we turned in homework. The professor was cool, I recommend!"
"Dr. Matlosz has been my favorite professor this semester. Show up to class and take notes on lectures. He brings the exam to class and goes over it before exam days. No class fridays, used for case studies. Easy A if you show up and take notes."
She is very helpful in terms of helping students get a job. Do well in her class and she will do everything she can to get you an internsip. A very nice lady
"Great teacher. Knows everything there is to know about history. He is a down to earth, good guy. Helps whenever he can. Make sure to write down everything he says and writes on the board-you\'ll see it later. Highly recommended for any history class."
"Amazing teacher, always willing to help. She really makes you work for your grade"
"Professor Olma was very easy. He was really nice, and understanding if you are sick, he will work something out, but not if its ongoing. The only thing that aggravated me was if I had a question, I would email him, and call his office, but not once did he return my emails or calls. Make sure to ask all questions IN CLASS."
"Very enthusiastic about it, he makes it interesting. Good teacher."
shes horrible her grading procedure is bull!
great teacher; has background as a deputy sheriff and really knows his stuff. Keeps class interesting and barely hw
"As long as you follow his instructions and don\'t argue with him about everything (even when he is wrong), easy A. Give extra credit all the time! Take him!"
Might actually be the worst teacher I\'ve ever had. Her powerpoints are overloaded with information and they make you want to drive a nail into your head. She also struggles to communicate through emails and is immensely disorganized. Do yourself a favor and do not take this class with her. Worst decision of my Brockport career.
"Easy, easy class. Never cracked textbook, but as a disclaimer I was extremely familiar with and personally love the subject matter. One caveat: there is homework nearly every class + 7-10 page paper; a surprising amount of writing for a rock n roll class. Scaffidi is good teacher, she expects you to do the work but a fair grader and willing to help"
This was his first year teaching Latin Amer. Lit. The discussion and presentations were fun but we needed more creative projects to do. I think in the future there will be fewer papers and more projects though. There is a lot of required reading for this class.
Mr. Vihlen was the first math teacher I have had that could get me to understand algebra. He is available for help outside of class and really does care about his students and wants them to succeed.
I am not a sociology major but I have really enjoyed this class! Professor Brown is extremely interested and always makes class fun (he has a very interactive style of lecturing). He\'s also very available for questions. I highly recommend Professor Brown as a teacher!
"He\'s a laid back guy, and you\'ll have alot of fun in class, as long as you respect him and do what is expected of you. He\'s always willing to help those who need it...He knows alot about percussion, and as such, it\'s always a good idea to take thorough notes (you never know when a random tidbit of information could be on a test)! Highly Recommend!"
"Although this is an online class, Beth is amazing. I added the class late and she was very happy to have me in her class. She extended all the deadlines and you can email her and get a response in an hour. She is gives good feedback. The work is not alot. I would take this class because you do learn alot. Get the book at the bookstore"
"He is a very old school professor, he always goes off topic.He always brings up his college experiences in UCLA in the 80\'s. He gives you a study guide for every exam.He sends you the powerpoint slides and shows a lot of interesting video and the lectures are interesting when talks about geology in today\'s modern day society. he is very sarcastic"
Dallavalle expects a lot of you. She uses a lot of books and the tests are really hard. She really cares about her students and she\'s a good overall teacher but her class wasn\'t for me. She\'s willing to meet with you pretty much ever and is very nice when you\'re one on one.
"Donovan seems like a teacher who wants his students to learn about Hawaiian and history and the origin and connections Hawaii has to the Polynesian triangle. However, Donovan leaves a lot of students confused because he tends to answer a students question with another question. He also seems to assign a lot of unnecessary and irrelevant readings."
if you are taking 321 do not take him... dr. sype makes this class way more easier than it has to be. dr. dankwa makes this class absolutely intense and a c**** to go to everyday
Hortensi is by far the best accounting professor at MDC. He really cares about the students and he\'s always available to clarify any concerns you might have. I would take him again if I could.
Good Lecturer.. He was very enthusiastic and helpful. Gave out lots of practice homework and problems. I would take another course taught by him.
"No homework, alot of studying. This is considered one of the hardest college courses, but he makes it fun and painless. His test are all written, no multiple choice. But trust me it\'s for the best."
Oh my gosh! This class was WAY too involved. Having to purchase tickets to go see an opera was ridiculous. The tests were also way too hard for an elective!!!
"Dont ever take this professor, he\'s boring as hell and you won\'t learn a thing. I learned everything by myself from the book. His first 2 midterms are ridiculously easy, but his final was impossible. Not to mention, MATLAB grading is unfair. If I were you, dont take him, take soemone else and actually learn something."
if you like to sleep in a class..take her... her class is boring... exams are ok but you have to memorize many details and 3 english papers.... overall.. she is ok but she was not for me...
Ogden is a really nice man and teacher. Reviews strictly from the book so test questions come from end of chapter questions. Whole grade consists of 3 exams and attendance is not required however to learn you should go!
"There is not much to say about her really, if you feel like reading course material your better off doing it at home. She doesn\'t make any proper attempt to communicat with students, I feel as though the board should have her reviewed. Any person with half a brain can read off a ppt there is no respect for her at all because she has lost it all"
"Dr. Cox wasnt a very good teacher in my eyes. I thought she was a hard grader on papers/in class exercises esp. for those who are only taking this class for an elective and who are not ENGLIT majors. However, class never lasted the whole period and she was available to answer questions. Probably wouldnt recommend though!"
a hard class made harder by the fact she goes 100mph.
"Very understanding to students, but not so lenient as to lose their respect. A great teacher and friend who is willing to go the extra mile to help you out."
"Out of all the teachers I have had in my lifetime, this one is the best."
A real math teacher.
"He is a very difficult professor and expects alot from his students. It\'s nearly impossible to get an A in the class His test are very difficult because he basically expects you to memorize every detail. With that said he is a great Professor, probably the best in the History department. He knows what he is talking about and clearly enjoys teaching"
Absolutely terrible! Gives useless homework and assigns way to many group projects with no time to meet with group members. Insists on talking in class and she texts the whole time! She thinks spanish is your only class and uses pictionary as a way to teach vocab. I changed my major after taking this class.
A very nice professors. He can be quite confusing sometimes. He also does not give lectures and you will have to read all of the chapters to be ready for the quizzes. Quizzes are pretty hard and demand a lot of time learning. Group project is a huge part too. You will have to do a lot yourself but will gain a lot from his class
Its fun but i\'ve taken easier courses with no paper
"This class started off on the wrong foot when the instructor moved the full day (8 hour) class up a full week with no notice. She is not computer literate and could not manage email. Three books were required for the course, one of which she did not order at the bookstore. Class time was minimally useful. Disappointed sums it up."
"I had Dr. Machamer for HPS 0613, Morality and Medicine. The subject matter was very interesting, and he really knows what he is talking about. However he can go off on tangents sometimes during lecture. Not a great lecturer, as the lectures seem to drag on, but if you like the material you will enjoy the class."
Does not know that much about health is pretty crazy if you ask me. I think she is a teacher just starting out so she will probably get better at it. Gives chances for extra credit but is reluctant to award it after assigned. Easy class overall just study and you will be fine.
"Dr. Powers has an interesting class. She allows very in depth discussion posts and the final exam was comprehensive, not multiple guess which I liked! She is slow to respond to email, but I liked her overall. I received an ""A"", but I worked for it. Group project (1 person does the work, 2 show up week before it is due, 1 does zero) all get 95%."
"Bongiovanni was really nice & funny, but she grades papers harshly and gives difficult quizzes."
Fantastic professor!
Bruning\'s a great guy and professor! Would love to have him again.
This teacher is super easy take her!!!! Very helpful and you will learn a lot from her.
"Nataliya cares about her students, no matter what anyone else who is in lower level math courses say, she does. If you ask a question she may think it is trivial but give her a break, shes a math prof. Your question probably seems dumb to her. But she will still do her best to answer it. 214 is jam packed, so be ready to keep up."
"Drawing intensive course - professor was excellent. Great facilitator of critiques, helpful advice for assignments pertaining to this class and beyond, accessible outside of class. Great at motivating students who are really interested in the material and their own work."
"Dr. Cantu was a great professor. His lectures weren\'t always sun, but I learned a lot. There is a midterm test, a 4-5 page paper, and a final. The midterm and final are pretty easy multiple choice tests with an essay. The essays are over very broad topics and are about 2 paragraphs. If you go to class, you should pass."
"I loved this class and I would take it again! There is a lot of reading. He has an option to read all the material online for free or you can pay for the printed book from the bookstore. He gives the best lectures and be sure to pay attention to his examples in class because they perfectly sum up difficult concepts. He has weekly ""quests"" as well."
"This is not as bad as some make it sound. She is a tough grader and if you take the 8 week version of the course the workload sucks. However, she is very respectful and she will help you if you ask."
"He is a knowledgeable man but is average at conveying his point across, although his course notes make up for it. The course is very interesting, especially the labs, but the lectures themselves are a snooze."
VERY NICE WOMAN!! Very helpful ourside of class. Does move fast so if you don\'t understand something you have to go see her about it. tests can be tricky but not unmanagable.
"I think Patsy is a great instructor. Before I took her class, I thought women being treated unfairly in the workplace was bogus, and she really opened my eyes to reality. She is passionate and knows her stuff!"
"He\'s a fun teacher and always seemed interested in people\'s work, he was very helpful to everyone who needed it. His lectures are a little awkward, he seems rather Introverted when it comes to speaking to the class but he means well and the class is an easy A. Listen closely to instructions, they aren\'t always as clear as you would like."
"After being out of school for 30 years this was my first college class. I took Comp I online as an 8 week summer course. The class was very organized, with lecture notes and list of assignments weekly. Burr was very involved in the class and always answered e mails within 24 hours and was very helpful."
You best bet is to get someone who can tutor or to take alot of easy clases and physiscs
"Puts people on the spot and is very one way. She always starts class early and if you walk in on time she complains about tardiness. If you know spanish well she will love you, if you are just looking to fill requirements, look elsewhere"
"Prof.Lopez is very passionate about PR hist & revolving issues within Latino communities today. Strongly opinionated & while some dislike that, I loved that he stood firmly by his beliefs Outside of class activities seem unnecessary at 1st but I seriously learned a lot. Review brought 2 you by an Accounting major looking for Easy A Take this class!"
"Poor guy needs to retire. I got an A but watching his recorded lectures were brutal. Lol, i dont know why the students in class didnt help him out more when he was stumbling through an example problem. Nice guy, but disorganized."
Fun guy and knows what he is teaching. He is always willing to help you out. He is easy but you will actually learn your stuff. I would reccomend him.
"Unfortunately the comments here show that 90% of Brock comp sci students are not problem solvers like they should be. The tests and exam were EASY. He made them easy cause 90% of the class was full of meat heads. My friends and I got over 85 on the first assignment, over 90 fn. The 2nd test had a bonus worth 17%. What did you want? To be spoon fed?"
"I brought the textbook but never actually read it, this is actually a very interesting class. He tells a lot of stories but there interesting and relate to the topics making the class better and we always get out early. If you do take him ask him how he feels about Walmart haha."
"She comes across rough and the tests are going to be pretty dang hard, just make sure you study prior and you should do fine. Group project raises grade if you do good work."
"Dr. Gilley is a highly knowledgeable professor. You will learn SO much from his class. He is extremely meticulous--be prepared. Don\'t be late to class. He is not afraid to drop you for excessive tardies/absences-even if you\'re a graduating senior. He has high expectations; follow them, be on top of your work, and you will do well."
shes amazing! my absolute favorite teacher! class was fun and it was easy to learn what she was teaching!!
"Kim was a great teacher. Very easygoing but expects you to work hard at the same time. Always willing to help. Plus she\'s hot, hot, HOT!!!"
"He is very knowledgable, but not a good teacher at ALL. Very cold teaching methods. Reads verbatim from text book. How are you supposed to learn ART from a book??"
WORST MATH TEACHER EVER!! I took her for mth 050 and had to drop because it felt like she was teaching mth 130. She doesn\'t take time to explain something if u don\'t get it and her tests were very hard. I wouldn\'t recommend her to anybody...unless u want to fail math.
"DO NOT CONFUSE HIM WITH Jack Lee. Considering Marketing course was supposed to be fun, this class was not very simulating. Lectures were routine, long and not very engaging. Not an easy exam, although easy grader."
"She\'s a very sweet teacher and all and she looks very easy. But think again, she does not cover the whole material in the book, but she does grade fair. I got a c on a test and I didn\'t read the book at all. Just READ the book and everything you know about it on the test. Than you get a good grade!"
"Be on time. Come to class. You have to read a lot, so if you aren\'t willing to do so, I wouldn\'t take this class. The professor is HILARIOUS, and I LOVED what we learned! I really recommend this class. Tests are easy, and they TA\'s fairly lenient on grading."
"Very poor communication and organization, very judgmental, not helpful, comes off very rude and plays favorites. Seems nice and easy going at first but quickly changes that impression. Worst clinical experience yet."
not recommended.
He\'s a real cool guy who helps you outside of class if you need it. He is very comprehensive and actually cares for his students.
Talks very Fast
"He very knowledgable, and extremely up to date. You will learn alot. His tests are not that easy so you will have to study a bit. Try not to fall asleep."
"I took her fall biology course and had the biggest challenge of my academic career. It it by no means easy, you work for every single grade you get. It is a hard subject no doubt but Dr. Hoefnagels has endless resources you can use. She really tries to help you I was on a personal study plan she came up with. HATED the class but loved the professor"
"I have enjoyed her class, she explains things and is always willing to help if you ask her to, she is also every generous with extra credit ."
She is not a good teacher.
"Pretty cool professor. The lectures are boring so bring an i-pod or do your hw in there; you\'ll still be alright cuz all you got to do is write essays and if you\'re good on that, you\'re good to go and you\'ll pass the class. Spelling tests are given which are boring and grading is picky but it\'ll help you in Eng. 1A"
Exams are all memorization. Make sure you go to class and pay attention and take good notes!
I took her hybrid class online/classroom. She is the most amazing teacher ever. If you have the chance to take her DO IT. She is super kind and understanding and really helps whenever you need it. She never makes you feel like you can\'t be great at public speaking (even if it scares you more than anything...aka me).
"She is a really good teacher. She gives a lot of homework, but it\'s all easy to do homework. All the homework that you do goes towards your final project grade. DO THE HOMEWORK! There\'s roughly a lot of reading, but it\'ll all help in the long run. You get 4 absences, after 3 she drops you a whole letter grade, the fourth absence you fail the class."
easy and fun class to go too...
Horrible teacher don\'t take class with her she doesn\'t know anything and from beginning of semester up to know she just texting in class shame on seneca college that has such a her professor
Was not nice and does not make his expectations clear. He is non transparent with grading and if he decides he dosent like you (seems to only like himself)watch out- shouldn\'t be a teacher
classes are super interesting..even if u don\'t participate you\'ll enjoy his classes..only thing about him is he grades kind of low..otherwise he is fantastic..totally recommend him if u want to learn something
He is way too laid back. Goals are difficult to decipher. I agree with the person who said he is likely to walk into a ditch looking at the stars.
"Daniel Brown is the funniest, most sarcastic professor you will ever have."
"Took this as an HU class, he reads off the powerpoints. at least homework due every other day. towards the end, he did not give as much homework. Honestly, just show up, pretend to listen, do the homework with no effort and you will pass the class"
"I can\'t believe I\'m paying good money to take classes with teachers like these. She never comes to class, ever! Lectures are terrible and hard to understand, basically she just defines words in a way thats way more difficult than the real definition. Tests are weird"
Pierre keeps the class fun and upbeat. His teaching style is relatable and interesting.
"this guy was horrible, if you like history take the class but he can\'t teach thats for sure, hes horrible. You can\'t even understand what hes saying."
One of the worst professors I\'ve ever had. He doesn\'t lecture on everything that is in the homework or the exam. He goes off on tangents and it is really hard to follow his lessons. He seems more concerned with making funny sketches instead of being clear in the problem.
"HARD tests, harder exams, unfair, and doesn\'t explain things properly. favours girls. take MARKOVIC if you have a choice!"
Probably the best professor I\'ve ever had! She is extremely engaging and incredibly helpful when you need advice on a paper. Unfortunately some people don\'t seem to do the readings at all and then complain that they cannot follow in class.
He is a great teacher.
"He\'s ok. As long as you do the cases he assigns, you should do fine. He tells you exactly what\'s going to be on the midterm and the final. I hate sports and have no interest in Law, but took this for an easy A. As long as you do the work, it\'s easy."
GREAT EXPERIENCE
freakin awesome
"I wish I would have had him for all my accounting classes thus far. He is a wonderful professor. He makes it easy to understand and learn. Encourages participation. It is a shame he is going to retire soon, but he has earned it! I will take as many classes with him as I can before he retires!"
"Andrea kicks so much ass. I gave her a chili pepper \'cuz I\'ve got a pseudo-academic crush on her. She has boring moments, but they\'re punctuated with humor like stars on the night sky."
"He seems very knowledgeable about his field, and is probably very smart. However, his class is repetitive, uninteresting, and just generally feels like a waste of time. He\'s given the exact same lecture to my class at least three times now. If you want an easy grade, this class is for you. If you want an interesting class, stay away."
This is an easy class. If you just listen she makes it simple to pass the class. She is really cool and laid back. She even has brought food to class for us.
He is one of the best Professor. I am not great at math he was avaiable to make sure we were successful.
"If you want to learn do not take him.easy A learn nothing by memorizing practice quiz questions.tests are word for word from the quizzes.most boring,monotone professor.classes are unbearable.no attendance but class is small so you feel bad for skipping.online homemade course packet. no textbook.""videos"" do not help explain math at all and he doesnt"
"Great teacher; I\'m currently taking him again for Discrete Math. I thought 1043 was fairly easy, but I think some people had trouble with it."
"I took the class over the summer , that may have been her only time teaching this class, but I enjoyed it and she was quite clear on topics and what she expected."
Best Instructor that I have in Mathematics.
"Very open teacher, lots of interesting stories about him getting his stomach pumped as a kid. Well thorough in teaching and makes sure you know what he\'s talking about. Very helpful and open to questions as long as he\'s not in the middle of a lesson. gives great reviews before tests."
"I agree, the work is way to hard for an introductory level class. Exams are impossible to prepare for. I would only take this course again if I were only taking one class."
"Awesome grammar teacher! Loves Shakespeare, and you have to love her sexual humor!"
he is definately one of the best teachers i have ever had.. take his class... seriously
Dr. Johnson is very fair and helpful. The class is pretty good overall.
"Worst class of my undergraduate career. And trust me, I went to a community college for two years and didn\'t have to go through a class as bad as this. Ms. Prager, as attractive as she is, is VERY harsh when it comes to abscences, tests and tone. Her lectures are very boring and monotonous, her tests are absolutely difficult, beyond this world."
Excellent graduate level professor ! He is a master at drawing out conversations and opinions from the class. Learning from others is the hallmark of a good professor .. Not at the graduate level to attend lectures. Very respectful and attentive to all opinions... Take him if you can !!!
"The semester started out relatively decent but as material amped up so did the professors attitude. I once made the mistake of asking him for help and he told me and I quote, ""C\'mon this is Calc II what are you thinking"". He then scoffed and walked away. I would not suggest taking this professor."
"He is pretty good at teaching what needs to be teach. Nice guy, might be a little bit dull but all information system classes are like that if you are not interested in IT stuff. Test are not hard. Always participate in class will get you a good grade."
"She is a awesome teacher, Very helpful. Can be alittle stressful at times. But as long as you do your work and active in class she is very helpful."
Prof Aaron is awesome. Lectures are very interesting and you will enjoy the different areas he use to analyze Human Sexuality. He makes a lot of funny comments about real life cases. You will enjoy class. Read the test review questions and you will pass.
good teacher she knows her stuff just do ur work and youll be fine
Probably the worst professor I have ever had. I personally red the chapters a few times and did not find them easily for the test(Physical book). Some weren\'t even really important just random things. I was given a horrible grade on my paper even after getting help from two creative writing tutors and received no feed back. My first D ever.
"Knowledgeable guy, terrible teacher."
"No need to go to class, every answer is in the book and yet attendance is mandatory. Ridiculously rude to students. Incredibly boring class, just reads from slideshow. Absolutely no point of being in class. He should issue the textbook and have tests online. Joke. He doesn\'t help when asked from students. Interesting material made boring. Terrible"
ditto
"got an A in the course - it was a summer session though, so maybe have been a tad easier. the final and major paper weren\'t too difficult as long as you paid attention and did your reading."
"I learned a lot in his class. Most people hate his class because they find it too difficult, but I was finance major and I took him as often as possible because I learned a lot from him. Especially Microsoft Excel! This has come in handy because my current job I am considered the go-to person on how to do somehing in excel. Thanks Dr Roskelly!"
very good and interesting! i love it!Prof. Hofmeister is nice and interesting and always ready to help and sit down and have drinks together.
Lots of reading but mostly interesting articles. Grace is super nice and down-to-earth. Easy grader. Definitely would recommend. Very chill
Richardson is the best!!!
"This class was the easiest class that I\'ve toke. If you show up to class and participate in ""Dicussions about stories"" and of course turn in your essay on the due date(it\'s not actually the due date, you can turn it in 2 weeks later). Other than that the class was fine."
hard
"He\'s tough on you but it\'s definitely worth it. Also, be sure to email him and stop by his office- it\'s beneficial."
"Three Exams, One Final, 10 Extra Credit. That\'s about it. ATTEND ALL CLASSES, ASK ALL QUESTIONS, ANSWER ALL ANSWERS, and do the 10 Extra Credit (10 Points on the final grade). His lectures are rushed through and isn\'t that great. READ THE BOOK, all of his exams are multiple choice and most likely from the book. So understand and read the book."
"OK, he is tough, but he has a lot of experience, know what he is talking about. He WAS probably a good teacher. Today he is just an old senile guy. I realized after 5 weeks that he hasn\'t taught me anything! He keeps talking about some stories or anecdote, not related to the class, or about how miserable you are. Should think of retirement..."
Ha ha. He leaves all the failing to Rodia. He has a heart but is blinded with greed. A money hungry snake. He should wear his horns and hooves to work more often. People need to see who he truly is. Do not be afraid to fight for what is right in that program. You will be heard if you do.
Teaching method is to read off book and explain nothing. Entire grade is final. Criticizes students who can\'t answer a question. Save yourself the money and self-study instead of taking this professor: you\'llike learn more on your own.
"Hollenbeck is a great teacher that is very flexible when it comes to turning in homework and taking tests. She moves pretty quick through her lessons but is very clear. I personally thought the class was very easy, but a lot of my classmates did not agree with me. Overall, if you show up to class on a regular basis you should not have a problem."
"She is awesome. She is a very kinda and understanding lady, I love her!"
"Very knowledgeable and approachable. Not like other lecture courses-expects students to take responsibity, ask questions, and let her know how things are working. Some students disrupted class to argue w her b/c stuff changed-but changes made papers easier and pushed back deadlines b/c we asked her to. Go to office hours-she\'ll always help you."
Mr. Cook IS the Centerfold of the Engineering Dept. PERIOD.
"I swear she must be an art teacher. Excellent at drawing, except for her beavers look like squirrels. Cagle\'s use of technology is extremely helpful (power point). It?s obvious she wants her students to succeed, but she won?t hold your hand. Great instructor, HIGHLY recommend if you get the opportunity"
"Ruth was a great instructor, one of my favorites ever at KU! The feedback she gives is so helpful, and she is always trying to make sure her students have all the tools they need to succeed."
"This is one great guy, and he\'s also an interesting teacher. Class was good, labs were cool, and he gives you a good idea of what will be on the tests. He is very willing to work with you and wants to see you do well, I would take him again!"
"She doesn\'t teach the class all that well, but she does give students the opportunity to rewrite papers. She\'s pretty fair on grading papers. There are a lot of debates in class between students and it\'s pretty interesting, but other than that, the class was really boring. She was almost always late too and kind of slow."
Realy good professor! Fun lectures
"This is not a class for anthro majors, its too easy and you wont learn anything. if you want an easy A and like watching movies that have very little to do with the subject then go ahead and take it. Bender, however, is a great person and really fun and easy going, if she combined that with some teaching skills it would be a great class."
Uncomfortable & intimidated by her. Demanding class but learned a lot & kept me interested. Unfair & careless on grading of essay exam which she just skimmed. Said to use own words but then wanted quotes from book. Contradicts herself.
"Really nice guy, Harvard Law Alumni, easy to understand. Avoid the 6:00-9:00 and you\'ll do fine."
She is very nice and explains things very thoroughly. If you have questions she will go over them to help you understand better. Her projects are fun but be prepared because you will have quite a bit of homework.
"For a PH.D, it is sad he doesnt know how to put the punctuation mark INSIDE the quotations (very annoying grammatical error)"
"she often talked forever. Got super tired and was bored forever. you could be on your phone all of class, so... but she expects you to know all the material."
"total ****, shouldn\'t even be teaching math goes solely by the book and doesn\'t really grasp any of the actual mathematics concepts I am truly sorry if you have to suffer through a semester with him as I have."
"He\'s so amazing!! I had him for Lab and he was so helpful! He helps us with most of the lab work! All he cares about is if you\'re learning. Attendance is key, 0 for labs you miss. Otherwise he\'s a lenient grader and makes chemistry so much more interesting! I would definitely take him over and over again if I could!"
Very helpful and good teacher. Cares for all of her students and wants every one to pass.
"I don\'t understand anything she\'s saying. Her tests are designed to trip you up and cause you to fail. Tons of typos in her work and you\'re still bound to get something wrong if you triple check, because she\'s purposely impossible to understand. Pass on her."
"He is the BEST prof. I loved having him. I learned so many things from him, i.e tips, diff.techniques etc. I would def.recommend him!!! Had him for 306,307, and individual and team sports class. He really cares about his students and will help you out when you need it. And his tests aren\'t to bad either."
"A good teacher, cynical as hell though. he is very knowledgeable about his field."
If you are looking for a great teacher look no further. :)
"Useful and realistic clinical information. He is among the best, I recommend him."
Take this class if you need a GPA boost. Ditto to all of the above :)
great teacher
"This class is very time consuming. The Home work is ridiculously long. It will take you 3 days of work to finish it. Prof. Gordn\'s lecture is absolutely USELESS. He is also unhelpful in his office hours. Instead of going to his lecture, READ the book. Everything will make sense when you read the book. Be prepared for his final. It will make you cry"
"She is my favorite professor this far; she made me change my major to public health. She is funny and always goes over what s going to be on exams. TBH, if you dont get an A on those exams, you didn\'t try. Has a lovely personality and cares about her students!!!!! LOVE HER"
this class is REALLY boring =/ we read the whole time in class and his notes are so confusing. I feel so unprepared for our first exam this week and we have NO GRADES for that class!!!
"Worst teacher I ever had! She didn\'t even teach, she read out of the book and provided NONE of her own teaching material. When questions were asked, she didn\'t answer the question. Didn\'t seem to care that only 7 people passed her class...2 B\'s 5\'C\'s!"
"Great professor, definitely cares about her students. She sent me an email about how well I was doing in the course and to keep it up. Weekly discussions and modules and 3 exams. ALWAYS do your discussion! or you will fail the course."
"DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS UNLESS YOU LIKE TO CUT, she teaches straight out of the book, no attendance, tests are tricky, and labs are dumb!sHE doesnt know anyone by name, she is not very helpful."
"On the first day of class, the very first thing she said was ""READ MY LIPS... you will only get ONE copy of the syllabus"" in an exasperated tone of voice. Her tone of voice and body language made it clear that she doesn\'t like college students one bit. I have to wonder why one would work at a college if one doesn\'t like college students..."
She is a very good teacher. Super friendly and makes everyone laugh. She did a lot of group activities to help us students practice signing. if you really wanna learn asl don\'t miss class because asl takes a lot of practice and using your eyes.
Hardest teacher ive ever had! she really makes u work. A ALOT!! I got an A but it was because i studyed my a$$ off and 4 the final if u get an A in the final you\'ll get an A 4 the class. NOTES VERY IMPORTANT VERY so please take good notes if u dare to take her and barely die. TAPE RECORED IF YOU HAVE TO!OH yes and NO cell phone(u\'ll b kicked out)
"Shes an idiot. She spends too much time talking about herself, and other peoples problems that we never even cover anything in class. Waste of money."
stop preaching and start teaching !
"Great teacher and is not hard at all. He knows the ins and outs of the university and will not make you do much work at all. If you have the chance take him, it is impossible to not get an A unless you hate breating."
"The previous person was wrong, he is not any of what they stated and he does no teaching, prepare to learn all on your own and hope you guess the right answers to his worthless questions."
"It was a great class. She encourages discussion, which is the entire period. She is a bit confused sometimes, but nothing major; we all get absentminded. Has a lot of interesting experiences to share and genuinely cares about her students."
"Very creative interesting assignments, very unclear instructions. Discourages questions by simply telling you to re-read her instructions. Basically lazy. Still references CS2 stuff -not updated. Very limited feedback."
"Say hello to human sloth. This guy is not helpful whatsoever. Doesn\'t know much, I dont know how the COB hired this guy. This guy makes you want to**** on your own foot b/c he is such a waste of time. Get rid of this man, he doesn\'t even seem very educated. He smells bad too."
"Professor Rose was a great teacher. The paper assignment took a lot of time and work, but was worth it."
"He is one of the coolest teachers I\'ve had. It helps a lot if you show interest in the class - he is a slightly hard but fair grader. The class was based on 3 assignments - one paper and two inclass essays - at 30% each - plus 10% participation. No attendence was taken but if you wanted to get part. points, then you have to show up. Take the class!"
"He\'s a good teacher. The class is difficult in that it requires work. Fraser doesn\'t hold your hand or give you extra points; he teaches the class, tells you what he wants and expects you to work for a good grade, which I respect. He\'s not always the most helpful at asnwering questions, but he\'s very knowledgable and a great teacher."
She is a great teacher!!! She gives you plenty of bonus opportunities. All her quizzes you receive for bonus and you also have a project you can do for bonus!! The bonus project itself moved my grade up 7 points. She is very understanding and she also brought food to class. Dont skip but she is awesome!! I would definitely take her again!!
"Casey is a pretty cool guy. Laid back and willing to explain things you don\'t understand (albeit sometimes not terribly clearly, but hey, it\'s art, not math). We watched a lot of movies. Weirdly, I do find myself looking at the artistic element in movies more now than before. Anyway, great class/teacher to get that fine arts credit out of the way."
"Terrific teacher. US history is usually incredibly boring to me, since it\'s been taught the same way since grade school, but Youngs managed to make it incredibly interesting. He teaches differently than most teachers, but it\'s great. I wish there were more classes I could take from him. He also does everything he can to help the students succeed."
"Terrible teacher. Didn\'t show up on first day. No idea what is expected of me. I\'ve never gotten below a B or considered dropping a class before, but am worried about this one."
"Terrible, I highly regret taking this online course. She does not help, only tells you to get tutoring. NASTY attitude and that\'s saying a lot since communication is done through email. Tough on grading, but to her credit she is leanant wih due dates. Probably to keep the class from failing because she doesn\'t care to teach. Did I mention attitude?"
"He is a horrible teacher. very arogant. Picks favorites and then practically ignores the needs of the rest of the students. In my 4 years at GW he was by far the worst, most arogant, and boring professor."
She was very nice and helpful. she was not too hard of a grader and it was easy to know what she was looking for
"Tough Class, but great professor. Prepare to spend about 4-5 hours a week on homework. It\'s easy to get 100% on the homework, but it can be time consuming. There are two papers and two exams. I failed both the midterm and the final and got a B+ in the class. The exams are not weighted as heavy. Just show you are trying and participate."
His lecture are fine and he is accessible outside of class but exams are not fine since we did not get enough practice. I suggested that he should put 60% question which is similar to the final and the rest 40% to distinguish the students(no take home exams).
"While not a terrible teacher, Murphy leaves much to be desired. His lectures are an hour and a half of him spewing facts at you, all of which you must be willing to regurgitate on the next test. His papers are long, 5 pages long. So you\'ll need to learn how to ramble. That being said, he is enthusiastic and knowledgeable."
Will work with you and gives you everything you need to succeed just need to put in the time to study.
Cared about students learning but unbelievably difficult grader. Would not take another class from him.
"I LOVE this professor. He has so much passion for what he teaches, and you can tell he knows what he\'s talking about. went to every lecture for the attendance, but seriously, pay most of your attention at the review sessions. book not used, EVER. labs rock as well, theyre outside"
"taking a class with and knowing this woman is a privilege. in the english faculty, profs who are both academics and accessible human beings are a rarity. laura is always willing and even eager to support students with practical and relevant advice. she is clear about expectations, has high standards for discussion, and fair evaluations."
"Professor Kirkland is a great teacher and lawyer. He lectures in class and then gives you online quizzes and the midterm and final are online as well. There are some homework assignments, but nothing too difficult. Just do the reading and take notes and you should pass!"
This program is a joke and many people switched to other schools and programs because of Lorna.
"Son cours n\'est pas facile \xc3\xa0 donner, mais elle vulgarise assez bien. Les lectures aident beaucoup pour comprendre ce qu\'elle n\'explique pas tr\xc3\xa8s clairement, mais il suffit de comprendre les ppt comme il faut pour avoir 100% \xc3\xa0 l\'examen."
He is Great! He really saved my GPA I hate chemistry but if you have to take it get him. He lets you everything on the test and grades easy and will explain everything and make sure you understand it.
He is one of the best professors to take for English.
"nicest lady EVER, treats you like you are 5 though. no need to buy the text, just study from her notes and you should ace the course"
Jim is the man! There is not a whole lot more to say. Class consists of powerpoints and he gives great study guides. No attendance policy. GREAT TEACHER.
"Dr. I keeps his students entertained during class. The lectures are worth attending (he sometimes works through the homework during lecture), but you can also teach yourself the concepts from the workbook. Dr. I is funny and caring, and I recommend the class to everyone."
Tax is not a great subject to begin with. She tells you at the beginning it\'s not an easy class which is true. Always go to class and ask questions. Do the homework at the end of the chapters.
awesome!
"An outstanding teacher. Makes the subject of Ethics easy to get. Breaks everything down to your daily life, nothing fancy. A really awesome teacher! I also had him for US history and he was great there also. There is a reason his classes are hard to get into. He treats students so well. Take him if you get a chance"
"Dr. Snider seems like a great person when you talk to her. when teaching she doesnt really use much of anything, most of the time she will write something on the white board but is abbreviated and doesn\'t make sense. The class is highly depended on reading the books. She will asks most questions that came directly from the very long boring readings"
not a hard class but very boring....He is very unclear with his assignments and papers.
Very ambiguous. You\'ll have no idea what your grade\'s going to be like until the last week of class.
MR. MCNEECE IS THE NIECEST PERSON EVER..HE IS INTERESTED IN WHAT HIS STUDENTS WANT AND NEED...HE KNOWS THAT NOT ALL STUDENTS ARE THE SAME..AND IS VERY UNDERSTANDING...!!!!!
"An egotistical ass. He thinks he\'s a big name conductor, but nobody has ever heard of him outside of Boston. He\'s obviously got some people convinced that he\'s a big deal, so they let him treat them like crap in hopes that he\'ll let them bask in his glory. Oh well. I\'d stay away if I were you."
Took him for Summer sem. Really good guy to take. He made the class interesting and enjoyable.
"Working on his Dr. and knows history, expects student to know it too. Talks about religion in class every day if you want to hear it or not. Let me out of here!"
"Dr. Volcansek really knows her stuff. You won\'t do well if you don\'t try, but it\'s nice to get a good grade you worked hard for. Take her because you want to learn something and you\'ll love her class. Don\'t take her to get a class out of the way. Lecture-based with two essays, two tests and a research design for Judicial Politics. Very nice lady."
"By far one of the easiest classes I\'ve ever taken. For the final, she let us bring in a notecard! This was easier than high school biology. Otherwise, she was very clear on any assignments/readings we had to do. She was very helpful with the few questions I had to ask."
"Awesome class, awesome professor. Lectures were clear and easy to follow."
"Very difficult, unclear in her directions."
"Alan is an awesome professor, he knows his stuff thats for sure. He does go very fast and covers a huge amount of material. Very fun class because of him, I learned accountants don\'t have to be anti-social nerds. Overall very useful, inspirational, and challenging class. I recomend it if you plan to become a CPA someday."
"all i can say is DON\'T DO IT!! He has tenure so he can do whatever he wants; therefore, I think he fails people just cause he can. It\'s a wonder how so called teachers like that even make it this far."
Extremely tough grader and unfair with grading. There are reading and writing assignments due for every class which becomes very annoying.
"She is rude, abrasive, and critical. She will give you an A but still say something nasty about your work. Her assignments are ridiculously long and she likes you to write using some stupid format called Bloom. She seems angry in her own life and takes it out on students. She doesn\'t teach anything, in fact she relies on Google for info. Not bright"
Professor A is and very intelligent.
The best professor ever. She helps a lot. And my writing skills improved thanks to her.
Super nice guy. Good sense of humor. The class is really interesting. The class is challenging but there are only two tests. If you show improvement he gives an A. Definitely helped development my ear.
"He get side track with his stories a lot of times. When he teaches, he will rushes through the chapter really quick. You will rarely have any lab days so be prepare for two lectures class a week. He does have good PowerPoint online if you want to study on your own."
"I had him for a math remedial and he is an AMAAAAAZING TEACHER!!! I HATE MATH WITH A PASSION but his teaching style made me like it! He really makes you understand it. He\'s young so that makes him more approachable. Oh, and he\'s hot too ;)"
"Best professor I ever met. His powerpoint slides are very clear and helpful. Beware you have to finish your homework before the test day. The HW due is often after the exam, the questions are similar to exam so it will be very helpful if you finish HW earlier. He is very understanding and makes everything very clear. Many students are taking again."
I took her class online and had such a great experience. She was very accomadating and always answers her emails with any questions you may have. There was plenty of work but the material was clear and not confusing. Really a great instructor! Wish I could have her for my nursing classes!
"Took this as a Summer Class, was a very fast class, and without determination can be very easy to fall behind. Also had mandatory online attendance during the course"
"Requires a lot of studying and memorization to do well in his HERS 314 class. Definitely gives off a vibe that he\'s so much better than everyone in the class, acts like we should know stuff while it is still being taught to us like it is obvious. Quite rude, sassy, and unwilling to help at times. Work hard & get on his good side and youll get an A"
He is very organized and you can tell he really enjoys teaching. His exams are very fair and they are open book open notes. He encourages participation and gives problems in class to help go over topics. He randomly picks up in class problems which are not graded but used as a participation point. Overall a very good teacher.
"He\'s is the most helpful professor I\'ve had thus far, in and out of the class. He has helped me with classes outside of his own and does not have much work required for the class. I enjoyed his strange demenor and over all, he makes even boring psychology entertaining!"
"I really enjoyed Prof. Mallette\'s teaching style and personality in class. He does require that his students write basically every class, but once you get his grading methods down these aren\'t too difficult. An overall great teacher!"
He is very cool!
Great professor! Russian is a hard language but she definitely explains it well and gives you enough time to learn. Books used daily.
"Sorensen is the most influential man in my life. He cares about his students more than anything, and is passionate about making sure we are ready and prepared to go into the world. He starts of with a news discussion every day, and he has us write a lot. He is extremely sarcastic and it takes a while to understand his humor. I would take again x100"
HE is the so great ..Go Boston...love his classes he helped me so much when i had the chicken poxs
"i think she works well for some who can see through to her empathetic personality. if you make it known that you are trying, that\'s all you need and she\'ll help you. she\'s a little neurotic but she\'s very kind as well."
"His tests are hard as hell, but has a GREAT grading curve!! He assigns a good amount of homework, but doesn\'t take off any points if it\'s late!"
"Atmosphere in the classroom is just uncomfortable, students work is referred to as ""not working"" or ""bad"", drawing skills don\'t really develop, but you will be able to write A BOOK about ernie by the end of the semester..Confusing, discouraging, disappointing class."
"Would not recommend, not understanding of student situations outside of classroom. She is very picky about everything. She grades all or nothing, I would recommend ANYONE ELSE!!!"
"Interesting class but not incredibly challenging. Attendance isn\'t mandatory but he does like to help out the kids who show up every day with extra credit. Not very easy to reach outside of class, which is kind of a bummer when you need clarification on an assignment, but the quizzes and tests are easy enough that it\'s not too much of a problem."
He is an awesome professor!
Dr. Harbison is one of the best professors at Siena College. He is extremely passionate and that makes learning the information interesting. Fair tests and fair assignments. You have to study for every bio class and this is no exception. I recommend him to any student.
LOVE THIS MAN. So cute and helpful and happy all the time! Loved this class!
"Best Professor ever, I got into Philosophy because of him."
"Pretty good professor, very knowledge!.. Added life to ISP. Loads you with Assignments.. no exams! Easy grader,maybe cuz he\'s too bz with all his grants but its all worth it in the end...Intelligent guy!"
"Connie is awesome... She is very sympathetic and understanding... Although she can be scatterbrained at times, her material is interesting"
"It may have been a painful class to sit through, but it was an easy B. Did not open the textbook all semester. Do not buy the books... you will not use them. If you show up and have a pulse, you can do well in her class."
"Hi Mrs. Jahnel! :) There is no HW but make sure to ATTEND Class & take lots of notes, as Exams will reflect lectures discussion. Exams are online. The 20page paper is really 10 2pg papers, & he gives whole semester to do it. You can tell Jahnel loves what he does and truly cares about his students. Entertaining and thought-provoking lectures."
"Information filled professor. He can talk all night even when class needs to end. He knows Hemingway real well. I thought he talked too much about Hemingway and not enough about Vonnegut for my personal taste though. He doesn\'t require homework, just two 3 page essays, one midterm and one final. But make sure you know your assigned books."
"My had Modi for calc 2 for fall 2014 and it was an amazing class. Calc 2 is a difficult class and there\'s no getting around that, but Modi is always open to office hours and her explanations REALLY help you understand. Anyone who bad mouths literally prob didn\'t study or utilize her. It also helps how down to earth she is. I def recommend!!!"
"Her class is very interesting and she is very nice but her grading is out of control. When you go to conferences with her make sure you ask what you need to do to get an A on the paper, because otherwise she will say she loves it and tehn give you a C."
"This class is not that difficult as long as you study and read and show up to class, also taking notes is very important. The professor gives plenty of extra credit opportunities, and if you have any questions it is really easy to reach him."
bad spanish teacher. interrupts students trying to practice the language.
Can\'t understand him
"great teacher, encouraging and inspirational. respects all students. gives good feedback. all coursework turned in through blackboard. this class really prepares you for QAST"
"Interesting class! Pretty easy! There are some writing assignments that he barely looks at and just gives A\'s too, and the tests are simple if you look at the study guide. He is very funny!!"
The class is not very engaging. She teaches straight from the book using the accompanied power point slides. She isn\'t that great at teaching. Doesn\'t seem to have mastered the language and has difficulty answering and understanding questions. Not good for people who don\'t know programming. Easy quizzes at the beginning of class and class work.
Don\'t take it unless you\'re a theatre major. Unclear of assignments and expectations. Lots of busy work and TAs are not helpful. Stay clear!!
Mr. Cross is a good teacher. He can be somewhat boring but he gets the points across. He uses PowerPoint for everything and post exam terms on Blackboard prior to exams. He let\'s class out early sometimes. You have to read a book and do a book review too. You will pass this class if you study your lecture notes.
"Inspirational, caring, and tries to help you get a good grade even though she grades kind of strictly. There is a lot of homework, but she will help you tremendously on the essays and drafts. She actually teaches you to write a proper paper as well, and if you get past her rough shell, she really can be a sweetheart who wants you to pass and learn."
"His test are extremely hard. Lots of short answer and only 10 multiple choice. The only opportunity for bonus is at the most 3 points after each test. DO NOT buy the text book. he gives the notes you need in class, so don\'t skip. You get what you get for a grade he does not help you out. Good luck!"
Great professor who knows what he is talking about. Highly Recommend.
"Although the material she teaches is awfully boring, she is extremely interested in seeing her students succeed. She will go out of her way to help those who request it and makes a strong effort to learn the names of all her students."
Prof. King is a great teacher. He is extremelly helpful with questions and i learned very easily from his teaching methods. I would definitely recommend his class.
"It\'s all on you. This class was so time consuming, homework is due every Saturday night, it isn\'t too long but it took me forever to finish because you have to learn the subject on your own. PowerPoints are uploaded for every chapter but they\'re irrelevant to the homework. Tests are tough even if you have the book with you. Don\'t take this class."
I enjoyed the class!
"She is a very sweet woman, but it\'s hard to learn in the class. She takes a while to get her point across and sometimes I forget what she is talking about before she makes her point. Only 2 tests and a final, and a couple pop quizzes. Make sure you know the material (even if you have to teach it to yourself) so that you can pass her tests."
"If you see this name on your schedual-get out. If you are trapt in his class- understand the book, learn the book, and when his essay tests come(no multiple choice)write the book answers, im not guaranteeing you get it right after that, he has his own answers. just show him where you got em\'. i never studied before this class, but i had too."
"Dr. Winters is a GREAT professor. However he demands a lot of you and you MUST prepare for the tests. He will give you test prep sheets. Other students say he was easy, but I found him very FAIR, not easy. If you do what he asks you will receive an A as I did. There is no memorization required, but you will have to write multiple essays."
"She is a GREAT teacher. Really wants everyone to get an A. If you actually do your work and don\'t slack off this class should be an easy A, and it is very interesting, you\'ll learn a lot. Probably my favorite class I have taken thus far. Take home tests, and you actually make some art in class. Take her, you won\'t regret it!"
"She was an excellent professor. She is a must, if you want to learn how to write a solid research paper. I started this class as a below avaerage writer, but left it it\'s so much knowledge. I think she really prepares students for college level writing."
"Dr. He is a very good professor. He makes sure that you understand everything, and if you don\'t, he is a great professor to ask for help. You still have to put in the effort and do the homework problems to get a good understanding of the material, but he makes the given information very clear and concise!"
"He is a really straight forward teacher. No big surprises on the test and is fair to all students. His style of teaching (mostly reading directly from his notes) takes some getting used to, but he tends to make class more fun as the semester goes on."
He is a nice professor and tries to make jokes in class but it is difficult to stay attentive when you are learning about rocks. The grading is very clear and it is an easy A if you download the powerpoints. The questions at the end of the powerpoints are almost exactly like the test. Not too interesting but also not too difficult
"She was very helpful, and loves what she teaches. It won\'t be a class you can glide through though, you will have to do your work. I highly recommend her!"
JOE is the man. He\'s gone through so much and he\'s still at it teaching. He now announces when there will be quizes so its not so bad. He has a great sense of humour and has good looks too.
"Payne likes to sit at his computer and let the accompanist play...you sing, and he says ""ok""...all while he plays on his computer or sits there with his arms crossed on his desk. getting him to help you is a trick, you have to purposefully screw up so he will work with you! i DO NOT recommend him."
Great lecturer! Hard exam though :(
I admire her as a person and as a professor. Really nice lady! I would take her again.
"Karen is one of the most helpful, compassionate and intelligent people I have ever met. Your mind will be opened by these classes- give it a shot!"
"have her for mng and mkg..just do what she wants and i think u should be fine,talks alot and likes confrontation but shes the only one that teaches it so..."
"Great jokes, out of class help not so good, the tests are a kick in the crotch."
This was a Middle East course which he taught with tons of enthusiasm. Very responsive to students and tries to help them. The lectures are all in powerpoint and he gives time for questions and discussion. Showed relevant movies and had discussions on them. Definitely take this course if you want to learn about the Middle East.
"This was one of the best classes I took at the U of I! I didn\'t think I was going to be interested in Economics, but Professor Gottheil made it very interesting with his stories and examples! I found out that 100% of the proceeds from his book go directly into Josh\'s Fund, scholarships for nurses who preform bone marrow transplants. Amazing!!!"
"One of the best math instructors i have ever had. Clear lectures, and tests are reasonable."
Rosie Rocks
A good class she wants you to pass and will help you. Works with the book so there are lots of problems to work from
Anyone who had Simoes and didn\'t like her was one of the kids who didn\'t get a good grade in her class. She\'s a great professor who really prepares you for the real world. Her lectures are great. I would highly recommend her!
"Very knowledgeable and teaches quite clearly. However, he\'s fast and you got to keep up. Don\'t even *think* of coming to class without doing those readings. Definitely not a class to be caught slacking in. Grades on a generous curve."
I had Carrie 15 years ago. She\'s top caliber! One of the best CJ Profs I ever had!
Dagan is one of my three favourite profs at UBC. He makes a real effort to get to know his students. He is always available for help outside class. He tries his best to make his tests similar to the final exam. He is insanely cute too :)
Hard class. Great teacher - helps whenever needed.
"Professor Kraenzle loves what he teaches and though it can get boring, he tries to make it interesting. He also has a cool German accent. The texts can be kind of hard but come mostly from the text book so read it. He also shows videos in class so you need to be there for that. There are also a few assignments but are pretty straightforward."
"You need to read the poetry 2-3 times, but you can usually get by with Sparknotes on the book (won\'t be able to participate in discussion but will do fine on the quiz). He LOVES originality on the research paper. Take good notes. He may scare you first to get the weaklings out of the class, but he\'s really enjoyable after that. His humor is unique!"
"Wonderful Professor. She was not an easy A, however she was not a harsh grader. Very fair in her grading and will help you improve your grade. Class was always interesting and I would take her again if ever the opportunity presented itself."
"I really wish I\'d had more interest in the class at the beginning of the semester, instead of after midterms because I feel my grade would\'ve been better. The chapters are long, and they\'re boring if you\'re not interested in Indians. There\'s a quiz usually every week. He offers some extra credit at the end of the semester."
Cortez is great
Metzger rules. I\'ve had every mechanical engineering teacher at Stony Brook and he was my favorite. He\'s funny and makes class interesting. He\'s the kinda guy that will remember your name and always say hi in the hallway and ask how you\'re doing. Wish I had him for every engineering class!!!
"If you show up to class and try, he\'s not so bad. Since it was a gen ed class, he was a little easier on us I think. He can be quite intimidating if you get on his bad side though!"
Bing was a cool teacher. He gave bonus points the day before the test while we were doing review and he didn\'t require the homework to be done. He was funny as hell.
"She cares if you do well in her class. Rather than blaming her students when an overall test average was bad she took the time to discuss study habits. If you show up, study, do the work you should be fine."
"Dr. Smith is one of the best professors I\'ve ever had. She is always available, will answer any question, and even goes through your homework with you if you make the time and effort to go to her office hours. She curves her test grades so that the class average is a 75 also."
"Come to all of her lectures. Taking good notes is critical for success on her writing assignments. She is young and new to teaching, so her teaching style has imperfections, but she does well regardless. She\'s very kind and helpful--her door is always open. I learned a lot. Challenging class, but not unreasonably hard. She\'s easy on the eyes tho."
He\'s alright he has an accent but you get use to it he is nice but treats up like were dump people. if everyone struggles he would help the class no matter what it\'s an easy A or B class if you just ead the book T/F. Warning he farts if you listen closely lol but good professor he\'s from idian
"Awesome Class. Lisa is an awesome professor who ensures that the class does well in the class and understands the material. I would definitely recommend her, one of the better professors I have had while at SJSU. She is also available for help if needed. Tests are average, you do need to study the material to pass but not unreasonable."
"by far one of my favorite teachers at mica. she\'s adorable, helpful, and awesome."
She\'s a really nice lady. But this class is a little demanding- especially if you\'ve never done APA style of writing before. She\'ll ripe your papers up. But she\'s always there to help you with your papers- just go to her for help.
"professor Vaughn is the best professor ever!! She is a super sweet lady. She is always willing to help you and her assignments are easy. There are three out of class essays and two in-class essays. Her lectures can be boring, but i strongly recommend to take her class. I didnt put a lot of effort and easily got a B (:"
"Useless as an instructor. She flies thru notes to fast to keep up, not properly explaining as she goes, just copying straight off her notes. She didn\'t teach what you need to know for the exam. I left and went to Mansour\'s lectures (way better!). Lets just say he saved my mark... get another prof if you aren\'t naturally gifted in physics!(like me)"
"Not for non-linguistic majors. Carleton seems knowledgeable, but it?s not translated here. Handouts and explanations are of course clear to her, but logically confusing to students,raise more questions than answers. TA?s admit their confusion. Her eyes are helpless as she walks around the classroom assisting groups. Class is poor, as is her wit."
"Loved him, such a knowledgeable guy, great with examples, and provided many opportunities to drop low test scorequiz scores"
"The online class is pretty easy. No exams, just lots of writting. As long as you read the material and turn is well written papers its an easy A. I took the summer class and it was really short on time, but I still got an A and had two other classes. I recommend this class ONLY if you don\'t mind writting a lot."
"GREAT teacher! Had her my fall semester for BIOL 101 and she was so great. Really easy to understand what she was talking about, and had a great attitude toward the students. She was also very accessible for help during office hours to answer any questions you had."
"Dr. Owens is one of the nicest professors in the department. He is willing to help you with anything; whether it is the actual class or program in general. However, if I hadn\'t had a basic accounting knowledge before the class I think it would have been really tough. He teachers from a powerpoint, but also goes straight from the book."
Professor Pauling is great. He is one of the hardest working professors at Charlotte Law. He is always available to help students and seems to always be in his office. His class is very challenging but if you study hard and talk to him during office hours you will do fine.
"An astonishing teacher! Truly one of the best, and anyone who has a chance to be taught by him is blessed! This teacher not only wants to help you learn, but will do anything in his ability to get you an A in that class! He is great!"
"She is great! She is very funny and grades pretty easily. She always tells stories of her son and shows you tube videos. If you are worried about taking a speech class, take her!!"
"Easy easy easy A. Love this professor. No deadlines, easy work."
"Had him for bio-medical ethics, EXTREAMLY boring class. Very quite, very old fashon, very slow. You can still get by the class easily by doing what he assigns, but its a tough class to sit through. I had interest in philosophy before this class but this guy makes me hate it. Long as you put in the work though you\'ll do fine."
Okay let me keep this really simple and plain as I possibly can that this teacher is in his first year and I most say he is better than some of the other teachers I have had in the past. The fact is that he is still young and not ready to teach so if you plan on taking a class do not take it with this guy he is extremely hard to understand.
"John is literally the best. I have to add this story about him. He will be the first to admit that he has no hips, he tried belts but nothing worked, the year after I left someone gave him suspenders to help him with this. I came back and asked him how he felt now that his pants weren\'t constantly falling down. ""I feel liberated,"" was his response."
"hilarious guy who doesn\'t bs his students. All his information is interesting and has practical application towards whatever sort of media production you are interested in. If you enjoy films and film-making, take this class!"
"I HATE giving speeches, but she made it easier. She helped me after class, cut us breaks in grading, and was easy to talk to. Her background gave her a lot of great examples. Just make sure you read the chapters--she doesn\'t give you notes for everything that is on the exams."
Very good at teaching the equations needed and how to manipulate them. Enjoyed joking with the class which lightened the atmosphere. His quizzes are also fun but do expect a lot of them.... real or not.
"This class was very clear cut. The exams are a bit tricky, many of the questions are facts, and the options are all very similar. She has you buy TopHat and takes attendance every class at 8 am. Unless you are early and waiting for class to start, you will miss the attendance. she closes it at 8:02 am. Don\'t take with Harper if you are always late"
Great.
"This class was really easy. Go to lecture once a week and listen for an hour. Then go to lab once a week. One bit of information though, when he says to do something do it then regardless!"
"I wonder if he really read my papers, or if my A\'s were based on my comments in class."
MOST students are more advanced than her.
"Cours tr\xc3\xa8s int\xc3\xa9ressant, visuel, le travail semble dur \xc3\xa0 premi\xc3\xa8re approche, mais le sujet est vraiment ax\xc3\xa9 sur des sujets int\xc3\xa9ressants. Bref dans l\'ensemble ce cours est vraiment int\xc3\xa9ressant, le professeur est drole et pr\xc3\xa9sente bien sa mati\xc3\xa8re."
Not a blow off professor. Look him up on YouTube! Weird guy all around but you will learn a lot.
"Goes over main points repeatedly to make sure everyone understands, is very open to questions during lecture, but he sometimes has trouble explaining basic concepts clearly."
"Great teacher, she wants everyone to succeed and do well. Very organized, marks tests and returns them quickly. Can be moody sometimes but if you get her in a good mood she can be fun."
She is so talented and good looking and stylish. i want to be just like her when i grow up. ( i lover here hair)
"u can pass easily but his class is boring and u would not have fun, i don\'t recommend his class if u wanna enjoy it"
"Great Prof! As an A student, I was shocked to get C\'s on some of my first responses but I contacted her and she worked with me and I ended up with an A for the course. I did work a lot during the semester but Dr. Harkness treated me like an adult and with the utmost respect. I recommend her but know that you will have to work hard!"
"Pretty easy, willing to help, take as a night class, its over before you know it. no tests just a few papers which are not that hard, looks at overall performance."
Way too much work!!! Way too much homework!
Very cool
La Raja is the man! The class has busy work but nothing to be worried about. He posts his lectures before class so that was where I took the notes and in class he had great lectures with a lot of student involvement. He\'s funny ad actually wants to talk to his students. Ideas are driven into your brain without realizing it and the tests are easy.
"Great professor - but not very approachable. Classes were interesting, and the use of group collaboration was helpful. I wish there was more emphasis on actually writing, as opposed to reading and analyzing a text."
"she is great ! made me love calculus. little mean sometimes, but her awesomeness makes up for it"
"Fun class. I was surprised they taught bowling here. Easy PE class and very fun. I wish it weren\'t half a semester class. Cool teach, she\'s nice too. She had a death in the family during my class and she was so sweet about it. She is a cut semi-old lady. Not cute like hot but like ""aww."" You will enjoy having her. Why is there not a bowling 2? WHY?"
HORRIBLE. Don\'t take her. Probably the worst experience of my life.
"Dr. Mike Is a great professor. He shows a level of concern for all of his students that I have not seen elsewhere at SDCC. The course is hard, and he does not dumb anything down. If you are struggling, he will offer help however he can, just seek it early in the course. Show up and take notes."
I had Jean for a lot of undergraduate professors and he was one of the best teachers. Had a good understanding and helped me a lot with advanced topics that others in the class were not ready for. He was very good at teaching the required topics but would work with you if you wanted to go above and beyond to learn more.
New teacher but honestly so amazing and knows visual basic very well.
"The class was not boring because she was really nice and funny. the midterm exam was harder than final. But final is really easy ; just participate, study and listen to her lecture."
I loved this class so much and she was a great proffessor very funny and such a sweetheart.
"This class really prepares you if you are looking to go to any kind of after degree. You get the opportunity to work on your resume, cover letter (or letter of intent for grad school). Sandra is a really great prof, there for you if you need extra support with academics and even personally."
Environmental sociology doesn\'t have any exams. Lots of assignments and reflections. Gives amazing feedback. I got back nearly 3 pages single spaced for my final project. The class is very activist based so you have to do things in the community and let others know how you feel. Must back everything up with evidence. Very caring and inspired me.
"Gender, Health and Power was one of the 1st graduate courses I took at FAU. In that semester, Dr. Cameron proved to be an impressive scholar, in her specialized knowledge of Ayurvedic medicine and in her broader discipline of Anthroplogy. She expected constant reading and writing in order to fully engage our discussions which were rich and focused."
"Easily the worst professor at the university. Arrogant, elitist and condescending, he doesn\'t even know how to pronounce ""Deuteronomy"" despite his ""credentials"" as a chaplain and such. Poor class planning...nothing due the first month and then EVERYTHING due all at once. Class could be interesting but his ego gets in the way"
Takes attendance & makes you actually earn your grade but overall a great teacher. Great at getting back to your emails & answering your emails & questions!!
"Tim is full of wit and wisdom. He enjoys long walks along Goatneck Road and makes fun of you if you eat your steak with your fingers. Kinda fem, but a nice guy overall."
I agree with everyones reviews. She used the textbook as well as other methods to teach. She always kept it entertaining and informative. It was an easy A as long as you study and paid attention. I hope to have her again in the future!
Simply the best professor on Earth. His class is a breeze and his tests are so easy. No homework. No textbook. Basically just show up and pass.
Do not get her for your professor...such as BORING class
poor
Great Professor. Test are very hard...make sure to study. During classes very entertaining. Will be taking all of his classes.
"Anyone who did not have a positive expierence with Dr. Forsman was just too lazy to do their work. She is fabulous and knows her stuff...hence the ""DR."". I recieved a B in a class I would usually get an A in, yet I still have nothing but great reviews for her."
"Mark is very clear about assignments, he keeps it simple and summarizes on the Moodle and I really appreciate that. He also responds pretty quickly to emails if you have a question about an assignment. Otherwise, he\'s a very good and funny guy, also he brought snacks every day to class"
"I didn\'t like her a first, but, as you get to know her better, she is actually really nice. Overall, her test aren\'t that hard, but she is a HARSH grader. In a way, i don\'t even think it is fair!! besides that, she is a very nice person!!"
"Easy class because it\'s just chorus. Music wasn\'t bad, but my main problem with Brinson is that she does not care about her students what so ever. It\'s all about her and in her mind the chorus would be nothing without her which is almost the complete opposite of the truth. Never admits when she is wrong and often cuts down students."
"Great Professor. All you have to do is read, discuss, and do writing prompts. You also have a portfolio that you must complete. It consists of story and poetry writing, so if you\'re already a writer, you will be at an advantage. I don\'t call it an easy A as to insult the class, but seriously there is no reason for a bad grade if you do the work."
"great - go to class and listen, you learn so much"
"Tarique is a funny guy at times, but overall a pretty boring lecturer. He says in the beginning that almost everyone that participates (either in class or by discussion over email) gets an A in the class. As long as you come to class and study a bit before tests, you will do just fine."
Found it hard to respect her. Drove me nuts
A lot of outside of class work!
"OHHHH MYYYYY GODDDD!! this was a very horrible experience and i dont know how she expects people to just jump in and with one example learn a concept! if math is not ur best subject, get a different teacher!!"
Russo is a **** AND A HALF! but if you are a theatre major then you have to take him. Just DO NOT piss him off. Basically his grades are ruining my GPA and he likes my acting and casts me so I don\'t understand what his problem is.
Made learning a pleasure.
"Mr. Coleman is a fantastic teacher!!! He works with each student and will take the extra time to help you understand whatever it is you may be stuck on. You can meet him in his office during his office hours and he will help you study for your tests by quizzing you and again, helping you with what you don\'t understand. He loves his students!"
"Great online class. Very interesting and you participate in class discussions. Connect program makes the homework tedious. Study guides are decent, tests more specific than the classwork, which is very helpful. Know the classwork because test extra credit questions aren\'t on the study guide. Extra credit available in homework and tests. 1 essay."
"He\'s a really corny guy who likes to give EI, but not necessarily helpful...His quizes suck because it\'s short and every question\'s worth many points. Doesn\'t teach very well, either...I learn more from the book! Also, sometimes the stuff he teaches is inconsistent with his quizes/tests!"
"Overall, if you pay attention and study for the exams you should be good. He doesnt use a PowerPoint or anything like that so make sure you go to class and get ready to take notes"
"Absolutely an AMAZING prof! One of SMU\'s finest! Not only is he an outstanding prof but he is a great guy! Industrial relations is not the most interesting topic but he makes the lectures very interesting by using relevant, real life examples. His teaching style gets to the point and he is very clear on what you need to know. He\'s really cute too"
"Interesting, fun and helpfull teacher! Passionate about linguistics and really interested in everyone\'s opinion. She is totally fair and interesting! She has Powerpoint slides for every chapter, it helps a lot + tests study guide. take her class, you will like it!"
"Jessica is a good professor. She discourages you from emailing her questions, but thats about the only bad part. The TAs ruin the class though, so a little warning there. My TA, Jack Fortune treated the class like it was an honors class and would annhilate my papers because of a disagreement of word choice. Her teaching style is very focused thoug"
"She\'s a horrrible teacher. She is very rude and unclear and very insulting. She got into a verbal altercation with a student in my class as well and told her to ""get her a** out of her class"" very unprofessional. Her quizzes/tests were extremely difficult and her teaching was horrible. I got a D and i speak spanish! DO NOT RECOMMEND, you will fail"
I loved her as a teacher. She was very helpful and interested in your success. She is also very kind
Class amazing
"Awful professor- midterm is ridiculously hard because it had questions on things we never covered. Also inapproachable and with a ""deal with it"" attitude. Gave very little instruction on the papers/presentations. And lectures are incredibly boring."
Jamie was great...take her for nutrition if you get the chance. She was more than always willing to help in any way. Jamie would always respond to our emails in a timely manner. Her way of teaching was awesome. She made everything easy. Read your chptrs. b4 class & study your supplemental booklet. Oh & don\'t be late for class. Highly recommended!
"You have got to be kidding with this prof! Stay away from any class. Not organized, and appears to not know a thing."
Grande is the man. Guy\'s chill as hell. He tells good stories and is real down to earth. Go to class cuz he\'s one of the few college professors who actually teach and he makes sure you get it. 4 exams all worth 25% and he tells you exactly what to expect. Changing my major to accounting because of him. O and he looks better with a beard.
BY far my favourite professor at Mac...absolutely engaging and uses lots of movies to reinforce her material..go to the lectures because she does test on the numerous movies and because she is really interesting!!!
EASY CLASS!!!! EASY A!!! dont even need to attend...all quiz/test are open book take home....it is very boring but who cares aas long as you get the A right??!!
You\'ll never see gouache the same
"Amy is honest & doesn\'t sugarcoat anything - something I found very helpful. I feel like I got real feedback from her & in turn became better at painting. She\'s really not so bad if you just hear her out, rather than being defensive. She knows what she\'s doing. Take the class, she\'ll grow on you."
hilarious guy and very helpful.
"Really pushed me to think harder, see more clearly, and be able to articulate the connections I made in ways other people could understand them."
This is the worst class ever. It\'s really stupid that it\'s a requirement for Com majors. Avoid it if you can! It\'s just a big waste of time.
"He is a very immature guy. He believes he is always right even when he is not. I\'ve had to schedule with him, but believes it is my fault even though I gave him at least two weeks notice. He treats students as kids and not as adults."
"Recommend professor Gomez to everyone. She is so knowledgeable and describes the material with so much passion. Her lecture passes by so fast even that it is 3 hours long. You have 3 research paper to write, but a field trip is an option instead of writing the 3rd paper. The midterm and the final are easy, she gives all the material on the lecture."
"Shana is the best professor I have ever had! She is always so happy and makes class extremely pleasant and something to look forward to. When you\'re having difficulty understanding something, she won\'t move on until she\'s cleared it up with you. I won\'t be taking another French class with any other professor - she\'s the best!"
"I didn\'t pay attention at all to the lectures at all, just took the notes on his powerpoints and did fine on the tests. He always made study guides for the tests and offered extra credit at the end of the semester. Nice guy and fair to all students."
"Took the course for a writing class, but it was pretty cool. Dr. Woldruff is pretty laid back, fair grader. Let\'s you revise, too. I learned a lot about writing for academic audiences and digital audiences."
"Pretty confusing professor. Her lectures seem like a different language, mostly because she goes so in depth and rambles on about one slide for a half hour. On the bright side, she lets you have a full piece of notebook paper for each exam and curves exams. Her lectures don\'t follow the lab material so it feels like two completely different classes"
"Her pros: quick to respond, has very clear powerpoints to go with material.Cons: Janet is very inconsiderate when it comes to teaching online. I warn full time workers like myself, who take full time classes to stay away. All homework was released Monday Morning and due by Tuesday night. It\'s a lot to comprehend already without having to rush."
"Kids do not do work in the class and expect an A, but this is not how college work. If you do the homework then you will get an A. Gives a practice test similar to the exam. Class average is a high B. Labs are simple too. Take this class because it will fill up fast."
Ms. Davidson was reviewed the material quickly but was clear and informative. Attendance and studying were a must to make good grades (as it should be). I took both Chem 2202 and 2203 and it was a pleasure learning from Ms. Davidson.
"The class is a boring prerequisite, but she tried to make it interesting and did a fairly good job. Her grading seems a little inconsistent, though."
Professor trotter is helpful.
BIO 101 is a college course and requires a student to work harder than high school. She is not easy but she is very helpful. She explains her material and give very thorough review with many questions seen on the exams!
"This was by far the easiest class I have ever taken. It was a session A class so it only lasted 7 weeks. The entire course is graded on a paper and a discussion board due each week (as long as you meet the word count you will get a 100) and ends with an online final that is completely open notes. If you\'re looking for an easy A, take this class."
took her for A&P 1. would not recommend her to anyone. she just reads off of the power points and VERY QUICKLY. she finished the lecture for an entire chapter in 45 minutes. she expects you to know your chemistry before you take the class. If you take her for A&P make sure you take chemistry before you take her class.
"He tells you one thing, then do another like he forgot what he said. Oh yea, when your writing your papers, make sure u dont mention words that he dont know, cuz then he will say you didnt write about what he asked.. Theres other words, but im gonna keep them to myself.."
"Very solid instructor. He brought good energy to my 8am class, which is an accomplishment in of itself. He likes to mention advanced mathematical concepts in his lectures from time to time. He wants his students to learn. If you do the work, you will be rewarded."
"The easiest teacher @ JCU. Don\'t even have to think and you can get an A in this class, it\'s that sick. His class is very very boring. He has a lot of work experience, but cannot teach. Therefore, he has 3 take home exams including the FINAL. All his exams are EASY! For an easy A or for a non-marketing major...HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
Takes the class way too seriously. She\'s not boring though.
"Beware of attendance quizzes, but you don\'t necessarily have to show up. He posts everything on his website: Powerpoints and outlined notes. His texts are FREAKING HARD because there\'s only 20 questions. Yeah, you heard me right. Eric is an awesome person, but not the best professor for freshman, he teaches more level 300 courses you can tell"
She is such a good person. She goes out of her way to help her students. She is a great teacher and a superb human being.
"Dr. Boyle is one of the most respected professors that I know. He is intelligent, caring, and very passionate about theology and Catholicism. I would take any of his classes in a heartbeat."
NOT RECOMMENDED. He does not grade on your actual academic performance but wether you get on his good side or not. I believe he\'s still here just to collect his paycheck and retirement. Might as well as stay home since you learn absolutely NOTHING in his class. Its teachers like him which discourage learning. SFSU badly needs to replace the guy.
"She takes too long to grade work, and the timed tests are too long for the time alloted."
Pretty easy class if you attend class and take notes and do the homework. He tends to cancel class fairly often (cancelled two classes right before a test). Easy to understand and does a lot of the examples to help understand. Gives homework for about 3/4 of the classes and the tests get curved.
Listens carefully to students.
"great prof. interesting, real world examples. partner at deloitte and touche. nice guy"
Prof. Flannery is a very good professor. He exams are difficult but he gives you the tools you need to do well. I highly recommend him.
"He is very unhelpful! If you don\'t understand something, DON\'T ASK! He will make you feel stupid! If you are good with math and understand it he is a good professor, but if you don\'t and need to ask questions or have help don\'t take him! He explains things very well and he tests and quizes are not hard but you need to have an understand of math!"
"For a man who ""can\'t remember the last time he made a mistake,"" he sure makes a lot of simple algebra mistakes. My advice, bring other hw to class, then study the book for the test! Or just get some one to check ur name off for attendance!"
You can\'t understand a word she says. She talks very monotone and she will put you sleep. She doesn\'t take up homework so you better study for the tests because those are the only grades you\'ll get. Better try to get through it b/c she\'s the only one that teaches this course.
"What an all around nice guy- very approachable! He often chooses films and clips that are unique and not cliche, and his love of animation often makes for some interesting clips. He can be a bit harsh when it comes to grading papers, but other than that, I loved his class and would highly recommend him."
"Ballroom dancing was so much fun! She will be tough on you but it is helpful! She teaches 3 dances: waltz, cha cha & bolero. The guys line up & the girls switch partners to the left every couple minutes, so it\'s not awkward or anything. I highly recommend this class with her!"
she is a great instructor I highly recommend her. She is also really caring. Just follow what she wants you to do and u will pass.
good teacher
"He posts lecture slides online and does not add much extra content during the lecture. So if you can\'t make a couple of the 8:30am classes, don\'t worry because you probably didn\'t miss out on much. I attended half the lectures and did fine. He speaks clearly & I would definitely have him again as a prof. Side note: you don\'t need the textbook."
"very easy, just need to go with your book and listen to her talk. very lil hw and quizes"
Great professor! The class is hard but he gives you everything you need. His notes were probably the best I\'ve ever had and he will answer any question. Extremely helpful and was speedy on his email replies. I took his \'super\' final and would recommend it for anyone who is good at memorizing. I recommend him to everyone!!
"Easy A, just do the work. If you turn it in early she will give you extra points, so that helps too."
"In SOC102, I had her at 7 AM. Even though it was a morning class, it was still a fun class! She really engages with the class and answers every question she can. The activities she provides helps with a better understanding with the topic she is teaching. If you miss a class, it is easy to make it up and take quizzes if missed!"
He is a good professor. Just copy everything down from the powerpoints and pay attention. The book for me was only helpful in the openbook final but you may want to buy it since it\'s a good reference. Especially if your notes aren\'t too great
an Essay is due once a week but she grades very fair. I got a B. Not a bad class.
Took him for ENG 350 and 352. He would go on and on about ridiculous things. Not helpful at all. Grades extremely hard on essays and he lets you know that no one gets an A or B in his class. Very hard to understand what he wants and doesn\'t clarify much. Expects everyone to write PHD-level papers. I would say AVOID if you are not the essay type.
"I love this class! He is a very funny man, and gets excited when explaining things it\'s cute haha. You\'ll enjoy this class a lot :] Don\'t miss any day! Prepare to take a lot of notes, but don\'t worry he makes his lectures interesting. Always ask questions if you\'re lost. He\'s very clear on everything though. I would recommend him to anyone!"
Amazing class. Amazing professor.
"If you don\'t choose Mrs. Beck as a teacher, you are ill-informed and unwise. You are unlikely to find a better calculus teacher on grounds, especially one as friendly, open, and willing as she. Best advice ever? Never study. If you\'re prepared everyday, you won\'t need to."
"Has a sense of humor, so that helps. Interesting examples and explanations. You can tell he is interested and excited about thermo. Engaging lectures. If you don\'t like sarcasm he may offend you."
"I did not like being in his class. He seems to have an attitude like this class is a waste of time. He is very knowledgeable, but he moves through the course too fast and I cant seem to find enough time to keep pace. He loads the homework and puts material on the test learned two days prior and even before you get the quiz. Theres no time to study!"
"She is a great person, really funny; will definitely make you laugh...BUT i could\'ve learned more about state and local government I am seriously bummed. Her tests are hard because you really have no idea what to study. And there are no class lectures just class rants about current events. This shouldv\'e been classified as a hybrid course."
"Ridiculously easy to get an A, but I found the class annoying due to its sheer pointlessness. No need to even do the readings 90% of the time. No need to spend more than a night or two on the papers. Just go and waste your time listening to him talk. Amusing at first, but it quickly gets annoying."
she doesnt stay on beat and doesnt give a very good work out. doesnt inform you about anything. i got a good work out on the last day and that was it. take her if you wanna have a lazy excercise day
"Can be a brutal marker and his tests and in class work will push you, but he makes a lot of info available, READ THE NOTES and do your homework well ahead of class."
I have to say that this professor was probably one of the best I\'ve had at MCC. He is completely fair and EXTREMELY helpful. His lectures cover only what you will be tested on and he will graciously take the time to re-explain if necessary. Quizes are open book and credit is given for an honest attempt at homework. I would strongly recommend him.
I love this class and the teacher is awesome. it is an easy A
"Dr. Chandler has a very dry sense of humor that I find really hilarious. He is a great teacher and knows his material well. His class is a piece of cake. He allows notes on tests, even the final. He is a great professor!"
Claire Cesareo is a really good instructor. I found her class to be easy but also fun. I would definitely recommend her.
"Professor Dockter, gives new meaning to English Composition, he really stands out in his field and his eagerness to help students is outstanding. He understands how hard writing and composition are and explains everything in detail. I really liked the fact that he allowed me to write about Historical Bias as that is my major History and I could really use the practice writing referencing that subject as opposed to a picked mandatory topic for my research paper. He is one of the best Professors I have ever had... Awesome Professor, who is actually working on his Doctorate while teaching the class. HIs involvement made it so easy to learn even though it was aonline class you felt like you were in the class with him."
Probably the worst teacher I have ever had. This class was taught and run so pitifully. It is a shame Clemson would have such a bad teacher teaching a difficult class.
Take GEOG 281 with Dr. Carroll. He\'s amazing! He\'s hott! He\'s Cute! I learned a lot from him.
"I LOVE YOUR CLASS! i think your tests and quizzes are easy but not to easy. i love your jokes they keep me awake and alert at 730 in the morning. your class is fun, interesting, and entertaining! i wish i needed another science class so i could have you as a teacher!"
"Personally I thought Steve was nice who really knew the material. He is a little old school meaning he hates if someone is late or txting in class so you have to remember to turn off your phone. Most of you grade is determined on how successful your four tests are, which I didn\'t like very much. Overall, I got through the class."
"Dr Fleming was a great Prof, She will do whatever she can to help you pass, as long as you put in effort. I would take another class of hers any day!"
"Seth is unable to take requests from struggling students, not changing the way he explains concepts. Hard to know what to study for -- he is very vague about what exams will cover (""just study everything"", then something talked about for one day would be 1/3 of the exam). Unorganized, unclear, unaware. You\'re better off teaching yourself through HW"
She was so nice and understood that everyone wasn\'t quite awake at 8am. Her tests were pretty much common sense. She brought in a couple speakers to talk to us too.
Great Teacher! Would definately take any class she teaches!
"Professor Fornella is very understanding. If you have any questions after class, she would spend her free time to listen. She is a fair grader, but she is very tough--she will make you work for your grade. I took the class before, and passed with a decent grade but felt I needed to learn more. Taking her class, I realized how much I benefited."
John is a good professor who keeps his lectures laid back with a few jokes thrown in on the side. His tests are difficult but they are curved so you should be okay. He also drops your lowest test score (not including the final) so you should be able to get a good grade. The only negative thing I can say is that his tests are very hard but that\'s it
"Serafy is an okay professor, you\'ll have to study from the textbook for the first month or two then he\'ll give notes. Not a hard professor, but you\'ll have to study on your own if you want to pass. In my class there was a few students with A\'s but mostly B\'s and C\'s."
"TR is the man. Best teacher in the world. He brings history to life, I legit love him. Deffinatly take him!"
"Super easy class, as long as you do your stories. Doesn\'t care if you turn in stories late, and is very willing to work with students. He has been around the industry long, and he knows his stuff, he\'s just a dinosaur."
He gives very helpful supplementary materials I advise you to write ALL the HW answers down given in class Alot of answers in exams that require your judgement and may not be in book as a reference for certain RARE scenarios in accounting He knows accountancy like the back of his hand DON\'T take easy materials for granted!
was a great class and she is a pretty great teacher.
She is by far the most helpful prof I have ever encountered at York. She knows her stuff and is clearly enthusiastic about what she teaches. I had a medical problem towards the end of the class. I was blown away by how caring and helpful she was. Highly recommended class.
Amazing teacher! Learned a lot from him in his acting for the camera class. He is such a kind teacher and cares about his students. He is also HILARIOUS. One of the must fun classes I\'ve taken.
"Not healpful, does not care about her students. She failed me right before graduation, so i am now in another semester. Don\'t take the class or find another professor for it!"
"Loved this professor, she constantly was getting the class involved which was great, and if your class reflects everything she says, than you don\'t need to take a final, like US :). One of the best teachers at Valencia, and she likes to dance!"
really great english professor. easy grader and gives tons of extra credit. class is fun and interesting! would absolutely recommend!
SOOOOO easy. I am horrible at math and got an A. Easy tests. Piece of cake no matter if you sleep through the classes or not.
Hilarious in class.
"For an 11-week Summer course, this was the best class by far. No textbook only about 30-50 pages of short readings that relate to the unit. Study Guide provided before lecture, therefore all of the questions on the test are given during lecture. Studying for tests is a must but class overall is great."
"The homework is easy but it takes forever! One thing I didn\'t like was that she said she would take late work the following Monday after it was due for half credit, but changed the policy later on in the quarter. One thing I liked was that she started at a very basic level so that everyone was on the same page."
Dr. Z is the best professor I ever had at MU!!!
Teaching method is to read off book and explain nothing. Entire grade is final. Criticizes students who can\'t answer a question. Save yourself the money and self-study instead of taking this professor: you\'llike learn more on your own.
"Karen is awesome, she\'s incredibly passionate about climate change, and she makes class fun."
Professor Carter is outstanding. She cares for the progress of her students. I have no art experience before this class and she helped me so much. She did this with everyone. She expects a lot out of you but its because she knowsyou are capable of making amazing artwork. I would take another class with her in a heartbeat! Highly recommend!
this guy actually kicked someone out of class for asking questions. it was not a big deal and he made it into one. he gives a 5 min break and if your not back exactly on time you will be marked absent for the whole day. this guy does little to help your progression in learning math rather than spew the problems from his head to blackboard.
"This is a very good professor. His lectures are quite long but he throws in a lot of interesting facts that are not in the book so it doesn\'t get boring. And make sure to take A LOT of notes because all the quizes are based on the lectures. Also, make sure to be on time because he starts lecturing right from the beginning of class."
"great personality, very nice lady, makes you feel comfortable."
Worst teacher at Crafton
"great class, easy tests, great instructor"
I hated plants until I met him...too bad the baby is on the way. :(
LOVED HER CLASS! SHE IS THE BEST!
"Good teacher. He makes the lecture very interesting. You gotta go to class though. And he does keep you the entire time, but it goes by quick. I took him for an elective that I thought i would hate and i loved it!!"
"Great prof. His interest in teaching is apparent, and he truly cares about increasing everyone\'s knowledge about subject area, not making your life difficult. He went off topic sometimes, but this greatly enriched the experience. Highly recommend, I\'d imagine his upper-level courses are even better than this intro course."
De Silva acts like she knows everything and she doesnt. I got a B in her class eventhough I got A\'s on every assignment just because I was absent 3 times because I had either morning sickness or I had a doctors appoinment and I even showed her the notes. She just talks about her all the time. DO NOT TAKE HER. She needs some tips from Ms.Silver.
Best prof. Not condescending. Very nice. Sloppy writing. excellent prof overall.
"She\'s definitely a tough professor but she means well and cares when you go to her during office hours. The class is pretty much based around the Group Project. Gives homework on McGraw but its not worth a lot of your grade. Only 2 exams: Midterm and final, which can mess you up because they\'re weighted a lot. But overall it wasn\'t a horrible class"
"Relates everything to his Lexus and working for Lenscrafters. First time teaching, does not answer e-mails. Not helpful and not clear about what he wants on tests or in class. Had Saturday class to review for test. Would Not advise taking."
"Made the material interesting and engaging. Welcomed student participation. I have NEVER seen a professor so universally admired by his students, and I have NEVER seen students so eager to start class each day. Not necessarily an easy grader, but I learned more from him than any other prof. Truly, one of the best prof.\'s SLU has to offer."
"Professor Stewart is the most amazing teacher. He records ALL his lectures & posts them so you can always go back & double check if you missed anything. Quiz every class period which forces you to study. Wouldn\'t have it any other way because it makes his tests easier so you don\'t have to cram, EXTRA CREDIT sketchbook helps u understand the info!"
Vergil knows the material but cannot relate it to others well. He tends to be confrontational and likes to berate students. He is now teaching at University of Phoenix.
"Hands down the best Math prof at UW. Super clear in class, super great notes, super nice prof, and super helpful overall. I\'m not the brightest math student but still managed to finish with an A+ in the algebra course - that is literally how amazing she is. If you have her PLEASE TAKE HER CLASS. It will be the best decision you\'ll ever make in life"
"Mary Jamiel is one of the kindest souls to hit URI! It is an amazing opportunity to learn about documentary film making from an actual film maker. You can tell Mary is passionate at what she does. The course load is not overwhelming what so ever, the assignments she provides are actually enjoyable."
She is actually the Dean of Health Professions yet she is one of the worst teachers that I have ever had. We only have so many lectures to get through each module and the first lecture would be spent listening to her go off on tangents on things like ****!!!!! Then the last day of lecture before the test she would fly through material to get done!
Just take if from someone else if you can.
"JERK!! Hates Greeks, Hates Republicans, Sucks!"
Do not take him!!! especially during summer semester. Too difficult with not enough help from them. The class is already hard enough and on top of that he doesn\'t help your grade out in the end. Avoid taking him
"Terrible class, lectures were dull. He pretty much paraphrases the 120$ book he wrote. Does not give clear feedback on exams. I absolutely will never take him again"
Great Professor..!!!!
"I have no idea why this man is teaching! This course was terrible! I was in the online course, on the module he teaches you one way, then on the quizzes there\'s a whole bunch of new material that hasn\'t been taught. I was very annoyed and disappointed in the manner he taught his class. Very poor job, I would give this course/professor a solid C-."
Solid Instructor. Had him for Linux and PM last semester. His tests are all written which sucks. Uses good real world examples. Kind of funny but a bit scary at the same time... I would not want to see him pissed off. Kids who listened to him did well.
"No homeworks, 2 presentation if u finish u will get the full creadis, 2 tests, the tests are kind of hard, you need to prepare well. Professor Zheng will tell you a lot you don\'t know or don\'t clear before. He is knowledgeable, take him definitely."
Good guy. The class was really fun. It\'s all hands on so be ready to get involved. Also be prepared to act in front of cameras. If your nervous about public speaking this isn\'t the class for you.
Nice guy but can\'t teach well. Too busy with his own stuff to worry about his students. Advises his students based on his own agenda. Look elsewhere if possible.
Loved Him
"Excellent professor!!!he really puts effort to his students. I was about to give up on chemistry, but because of him now I feel more comfortable. He even gives tutoring!!!best one in the chemistry department!!"
Great teacher...really really funny. Really easy class.
"Great prof. He really introducing the students to the Celtic world and it\'s history. I took 3 of the literature courses that he teaches (Early Lit, Medieval Lit, and Arthur) and each one was amazing. As long as you attend the classes and do the readings you will end up with at least a B+. His classes are the type that you are happy to attend."
This professor was one of the most frustrating professors I have taken at UNC. He is unclear about expectations and his tests are crazy long and confusing. His classes constantly put me to sleep and he reads straight from the book. Will never take his class again.
Awesome guy & professor!
she was good
"Erin is a freaking gem. She is kind and understanding and her class is enjoyable. I HATE writing papers, but she\'s such a sweet soul that it makes you want to try hard for her. Super doable class if you put in the work necessary. 3 papers worth 20% of grade, and annotated bib worth 15% and the rest is participation. Very enjoyable class for gen ed."
"Davis is incredibly kind, but his class is seriously exhausting! Don\'t take him if you\'re looking for an easy A, can\'t handle people who stutter, or do bad on tests. Since homework isn\'t graded, it\'s easy to fall behind, but if you\'re able to manage your time well, then go for it. It\'s probably best to save yourself the stress&go with someone else."
"Prof Falcon is the most enthusiastic instructor I have ever had, and that is without exaggeration. She is genuinely invested in the success of her students and will bend over backwards to help you if you need it. The course requires a lot of homework, but Prof Falcon is more than willing to work with you on due dates. She is one of the best at USNA"
hard to get used to his lescture style at first but worth it. accomodating and hands out extra credit for showing up.
He\'s a great teacher who knows and loves his craft. He teaches Drama 134 Voice&Diction and he\'s a real gem.
Great Professor and very caring. I really enjoyed the way she included teaching tips into her curriculum. She gives notetakers and outlines the entire course for you! Great help! I enjoyed this class.
"In the beginning she was terrible, the class average for the first exam was a D- and she blamed it on the class and said it was all our fault we all failed. After the first exam though she did get better, she taught more tailored to her exams and she wanted to help us because she realized she messed up. So her class is doable."
"Easy professor. Yes, his lectures are painful, but it\'s an easy ""A"". Attend class because that\'s part of the points he gives out. Study his guides and sample questions to be in good shape."
"Libretti is funny, creative and smart, making early American literature come alive. He introduces you to the methodologies of literary criticism, its conventions and research. He expects you to synthesize his classroom lectures with your own take on the texts. Students w/o a sense of humor won\'t appreciate his style."
Smart teacher but class structure is horrible. Exams have little to do with class content. She lectures from Powerpoints every day and says \'right\' nearly every other word.
"One of the nicest professors at Ramapo. Actually cares about the students she\'s teaching. Her lectures would often drag on, but that\'s because I had no interest in the class. If you are invested in what you\'re learning, you will enjoy the knowledge she brings. I still walked away with an A and that would not be the case with many other professors."
"Shes a really good stats Teacher. Test are 90% and homework is 10% I didnt do the homework because it was so much for so little credit. She lets you use one sheet of notes for tests, and she also does a study session before tests so you can know exactly what is going to be on the test. I would recommend her class."
Really knows the subject she is an awesome instructor. Who really wants her students to be successful.
"Very knowledgable, wants what\'s best for her students."
"Jan is a nice lady if you know her outside of class. But be prepared for a lot of work. Her classes are NOT easy As. There are not any actual exams, but there most likely will be a paper or papers during the semester. She also has a lot of difficulty explaining what she wants, so clarity is a big issue."
Don\'t take unless you want to waste your time/money for nothing. She is not worth it.
"Very relaxed and laid back! Thom\'s an awesome prof and has an amazing studio...oh, and he doesn\'t talk on his phone all the time. FACT."
Incredibly intimidating but amazing class.She\'ll tear apart your papers if you slack off but she\'s really helpful if you go to see her. Definitely worth the extra-effort you put in. Tests are mult-choice but definitely not easy
"Prof. Darby has clear grading criteria, great lectures and all the hands-on assignments help so much for the real work experience."
"Very hard, but helpful"
She is an average professor. She is very into memos and we don\'t get a lot of practice with other forms of business writing. The assignments are challenging but good for learning. It becomes clear early on that she will grade some students more fairly than others if she likes them. It is true she takes a very long time to grade assignments.
"Basic math class if you are good at math it is a breeze, if your not so good he works hard to help you understand, lots of extra credit great teacher"
"He is very nice. You can\'t change the subject material, and nobody likes Cal II. If you have to take Cal II I\'d take him. His English isn\'t very good yet, but he is nice and helpful. Don\'t argue with him on test questions though...it will just make him not want to give you credit. Being polite about it works best."
"Grundmann is a nice man, but a little quirky. If you wholeheartedly put in the effort it\'s not hard to get an A on the exercises. He offers A LOT of extra credit, take advantage of it! I managed to get an A even though I didn\'t do so well on his exams. Tests are always hard though even when the study guide is almost the same thing."
"Love this guy! sometimes fails in his explanations of calc ideas, but for the most part... does a good job of making calculus pretty simple. only one hw assignment each week that takes maybe an hour or two. Come to class, take notes, do hw, get help if you don\'t understand, and this class shouldn\'t be too hard. Joyce is very nice & cares. take him!"
Prof. Haftel is legit one of the best professors in the Department. Her lectures are very engaging but its all worth it.
We had a great class- she was fair & fun so good for summer class
"You could tell he was very passionate about what he was teaching and he tried to make the lectures interesting. The tests were very easy, he uses recycled questions from the homework quizzes. He also gives extra credit for going to zoology seminars once a week."
"He is an amazing teacher. Theres not a lot of work, the class is very fun, you dont need a textbook at all. You get a packet the first day and thats what you need for test. You get one essay 3-4 pages and 3 test all 33 multiple choice, right out of the packet. He\'s extremely funny, and very easy to understand. I definitly reccommend his class."
"She is the absolute worst teacher im the TAMs major, and it is a shame students are forced to take classes with her as she is the only one teaching certain classes. She does not know how to teach mathematics, so if you like teaching yourself from the book, you will love this class. Don\'t think about missing in class assignments or you will not pass"
This Prof made it very difficult to improve. I received the same grade no matter if I put in a ton of work or no work at all. I wish this was anonymous grading. She is much more difficult than the other LW Profs...
"A bad online instructor. Course schedule was outdated and incorrect. Three weeks into the 8wk course he ""revised"" it, but the revision was incorrect as well. Frequently, online dropboxes for assignments due at 1055PM closed at 6PM. Instructions were often vague. Highly unorganized course and the professor never made any attempt to make it better."
Confusing---won/t help if you want to pass the comps!
"Absolutely terrible - AVOID at all costs. She makes no effort to connect with students is very indecisive, and is not clear on assignments. Tests are never correlated with the class/textbook material and her office hours are slim. Again, don\'t waste your time or money with this professors - it\'s simply not worth it."
"This class is really tough, I changed my nursing major because this class is so discouraging. Usually has 2 quizzes in the beginning & end of class with very little to no time to study before the in-class one. He\'s picky with spelling and if you don\'t include a specific word, you get the whole thing wrong. Lectures are fast paced and insufficient"
"It\'s true that he is incredibly boring to listen to but easiest grade ever for a second year sociology class! He posts all the slides, tells you exactly what is on the midterm and final, and the paper was not hard either. I took a summer class with him and it was the easiest mark I\'ve gotten throughout my degree."
"Really cool guy but hes hard of hearing so its kinda difficult to participate in class. Other than that, Only a couple assignments like a research paper and then a few tests and a couple extra credit quizzes. Really interesting classes and he makes them more enjoyable."
Too bad this is his last year. This guy really knows his stuff and does a great job explaining it. He really takes time crafting his lectures and it shows. He is very enthusiastic and super helpful. His tests are hard but if you do the homework and pay attention they shouldn\'t be a problem and he curves them fairly.
"Great and knowledgeable professor that wants you to learn the subject in depth. Very frustrating at first but once you study the material, you begin to understand her argument. You learn a lot..and that\'s what college is for"
"thier is a good amount of work, but the class is very enjoyable. no one fails at all, its well worth the work and you will have fun"
"Pretty good! Good attitude towards the students. He is helpful and knows the meterial, although he likes to digress and tell a lot of stories in class."
"Dr. Stark is hands down one of the best professors I have had in both undergraduate and graduate school. He is well respected by the majority of the students that he has had, helpful, experienced, and intelligent. Anyone who puts in the time and effort will do well in his classes."
Great teacher!
"Ratzman is a great teacher, he explains everything very thoroughly, and he always asks if anyone has questions so we know the material taught. The only real work is reading and a short short paper, and he is a very lenient grader."
Professor McNutt made this online conservation class interesting. She responds quickly to emails and assigns a very reasonable amount of homework. Highly recommended!
Easy online class. Assignments are mandatory. The tests are timed.
Surprisingly easy and exciting. The hour+ discussion isn\'t as intimidating as it sounds. I HATE speeches and these 2 were super easy. 1 of them isn\'t even graded. Papers are fun to write and essay exams are easy as long as you make a brief outline of the notes and talk with other students. I got 100% on both. I highly recommend this course.
Speaks very little English in class and the class is challenging. Attendance is mandatory but if you go to class you will learn. Prof Decker is EXTREMELY helpful. One of the best Foreign Language professors at Mason
Awesome guy and a great teacher. Strongly recommended. His classes are easy. Definitely the best professor I have had in college.
Professor gives great work. She helps us prepare for business presentations.
Ms. Meyer is a hysterical teacher. She finds a way to easily relate stories about her life to the works you read in class. Her grading on essays is fair and it is apparent she wants to help you grow as a writer and person. I would highly recommend.
Hardest professor ever. Will push to the limit. prepare for days and nights of study.
"Research all the examples from lecture not in the textbook/that sound unfamiliar. Record & re-listen to his lectures. Read every single chapter, but focus mainly on the vocab - they could be on the test & do help with understanding concepts. Study consistently. Go to O.H. and email him for help (more lenient with grade!!) Hates phones/talking!"
I loved history before I took this class and he ruined it. Sitting through his class for 2 hours is torture. He\'s horrible at lectures and makes you waste your time with a ton of ridiculous assignments. Simulations are a joke. Worst class I\'ve ever taken. STAY AWAY!
"Prof. Cass is one of the hardest professors on campus, but is willing to spend time working with his students. He assigns a large number of assignments, but is fair in grading. I would highly recommend him if you\'re interested in the subject."
"If any students wish to acquire a substantial amount of knowledge regarding the criminal justice system,I recommend this professor. Most students pay their tuition fees so they gain an understanding of the course content and this professor does an exceptional job of helping you comprehend.She also assists students who require help. She\'s awesome."
"NOT a good professor. NO podcast, NO textbook, NO descriptive lecture slides. You have one chance to take down the material and that is when he is speaking during class. If you miss what he said, you are in trouble. Horrible class organization. Not conducive to learning in my opinion..."
Great teacher. Smart and passionate. Breaks down theories+readings clearly and concisely. Workload seems heavy at first but do-able. His class is worth taking. Would definitely take him again. Also helps that he\'s easy on the eyes...I sure paid attention!
"Nice easy teacher. Just go to class hang out and discus what she wants to talk about. Get out early alot, and she\'s pretty easy going. Excellent teacher."
"lazy:exams consist of 10 multiple choice&about5open,&matching for 10 points. Multiple choice ?s are not clear & w.misspells in key terms.open?s are graded subjectively w.clear favoritism.+she shows up for tests&quizzes w.out enough copies class, power points are not ready, often with a lot of mistakes because she copies them from somewhere online."
"I didn\'t even buy the textbook, but I Aced the class. There is 1 PPT presentation with a partner (simple and low-stress), a study guide (which gives you page numbers to the answers), a 14 page paper (applying theories to your own life experiences and no research required), and four, one-page reaction papers to guest speakers. Easy A, no stress!"
Professor Collins is fantastic! He is so much fun and has realistic expectations for his students. He is truly interested in his field and shows that every class. Please take one of his classes - you will love him!
She\'s is definitely going to make you work for your grade. A lot of homework. DOES NOT DROP ANY GRADES!
"Great prof! Has a true interest in the subject and the success of his students. Very approachable, responds to emails, and makes the course material easy to understand. Tests and exams are fairly easy if you study what he teaches in class and do the readings. Assignments really help bring up marks. I would take another class with him."
Great teacher that really cares about her students. the material is difficult. You must read the text to fill in any blanks. My best advise be prepared for class by reading ahead.
Good professor. She really wants to help you to learn the material.
"From an active student\'s perspective, Anelia was a good teacher. Her class was a little unstructured: attendance not taken, assignments and due dates negotiated, and class discussion changing with current events. She offered many chances to get real world experience. I recommend her if you\'re willing to participate outside of class."
"Government is a particularly uninteresting subject for me, however Ethan is such a phenomenal teacher I was easily able to overcome my disinterest and get involved in the material."
I want to like her - I really do. But I\'ve decided that it\'s best for me to stay clear of her as much as possible. Her priorities are obviously not with the student but seem to be more about her career and position within the department and university. It\'s a shame too; she has so much to offer to the student body.
"Dr. Yuen is very thurough with notes she presents to the class and her assignments are geared towards the quizzes and tests. While some people say her tests are not represenatative of the homework she assigns, they are generally just problems that have multiple principles in them that you\'ve learned."
Very clear on his expectations and explains everything in meticulous detail. The tests are very similar to homework. Study and show up to class and you will pass with an A or B no problem.
"Dr. Chew is adorable, he cares for his students and is very knowledgeable. He moves quickly; however, if you focus while he lectures, take good notes, and put in the time needed to study for exams, you will do fine. His exams are tough but always curved. Focus on understanding rather than memorization. You will grow to love him."
"Hes top notch, a true philosophe if u will... Hes probably the toughest grader ive ever encountered, but he will make me better for it. Take him if u want a challenge."
"Ms.Love is awesome. There is a lot of reading but most of the stories are fun, interesting, you can relate to the stories. There are small 1 page essays (extremely easy). She makes a good and fun environment. Attendance is really important for her. She loves discussions & volunteers. I am rating her now so you can choose her for spring! TAKE HER!!"
"LOVED this man... he is like a grandfather, and he tells funny stories...can get boring but takes a 5 minute break every class. extremely helpful, and he learns people\'s names quickly.. awesome teacher and wicked nice man!!!"
"She always changes her mind on assignments and she is never clear. She\'s not the best, I cant take her seriously."
"very good teaching style, much better than high school spanish. I like the speed she goes at, and she is very cool with making up assignments."
"Excellent, he is one of the best"
"Really such a lovely, kind woman. Her lectures are interesting, informative and organized. She gives a study guide for each test and each quiz. If you learn the material on the guides, you will do really well! Just make sure to pay attention during her lectures and make it to class! I really enjoyed having Ms. Hattoh as my professor."
Professor Gainous is incredibly helpful and really makes boring material a little less boring. I went to him outside of class because of trouble with the research material and he was nothing but helpful and encouraging. I would definitely take him again.
Very nice prof. He does his best to help you understand the material. Tough class. In class he can seem a bit \'frazzled\' and rushed because he often worries about running out of time. However has office hours and will take the time to slow things down and help you step by step and figure out a method that works for you He cares a lot about students
"Ms. Johnson came to class unprepared, could not answer our questions, and was extremly unsuccessful in helping us as students to succeed. Two-thirds of the class dropped the course. I wrote a letter of complaint to the Department chairman."
"I was very interested in the subject before taking his class, and Citrin made me more interested in the world of finance. He has a lot of real world financial experience and interesting philosophies, and he makes you think about what kind of investor you want to be without pushing you one way or another. I\'d go out of my way to take him again."
"Great guy! The only homework you\'ll ever have are the handful of projects. Exams aren\'t too tough. Just study notes. If you make A\'s on the first two Exams, you\'re exempt from the final. Just do the work and you\'ll come out with an A. Anybody who says it was too hard was looking on Ebay all class period! Note: there are mirrors on the walls."
"His class was okay. It took him weeks to grade the discussion board, but it was all good in the end. Very easy class just quizzes, midterm, final, discussion board each week, and a paper. :)"
Best teacher I\'ve ever had
"Lectures do tend to lag on a bit, but they are informative and he tries to make it entertaining as much as he can. His film choices are also good examples of the varying lectures."
"I never thought I would hate learning about the constitution, but I do now. Prof. spends to much time on liberal political doctrine. If you speak in class, you will be wrong. I you learn the material through other sources other than the case book, you will be wrong. Unless you are ultra liberal, avoid!"
"My classmates are right. This prof is freekin useless. Bad teacher, does not anzwer our questions and cannot make a decision that she will stick to. Tells one person one thing and others something else. Bad news."
"This man can talk till his lungs collapse. had him summer 1, and damn! You for sure need your book b/c you don\'t always know if he\'s on subject or not. not till the end when you didn\'t know if to write it down or if it was just fyi stuff"
"He did not really seem sure of what he was teaching, had to be corrected by students multiple times. Tests did not reflect what he covered in class. Syllabus was incorrect. Several mistakes on the final, including numbering which went along with the scantron. One of the worst professors I have had."
The class is a real eye opener and very interesting. If you put a lot into you will get a lot out of it. Leoni is an excellent teacher and one of the best that I have had.
"AVOID THIS CLASS! It is impossible to follow his line of thinking in class. He talks to fast to take decent notes and class, and he gets frustrated when you ask him to repeat himself. He does not offer a break during the 2 hour class, and it\'s impossible to stay tuned in for the entire time."
"Relies heavily on powerpoint presentations, not too demanding, always clarifies material when in question. Homework done on volunteer basis. Lots of extra credit opportunities, which helped me when I bombed the final. Lectures can be boring at times. I enjoyed this class. Very flexible off campus type learning."
She is a hard professor but at this stage of your teaching development she expects her students to demonstrate mastery. Very willing to help students that first help themselves. I would recommend reading the syllabus and then asking all the questions you need to feel like you know what is expected.
This class was amazing! I really would take my next calc with this professor if he would teach one. He always gives prequizes and its pretty easy to prepare for them.
"He will explain anything you need until you get it. He is really nice, helpful and funny."
"she\'s mean, she does not know what she is talking about, she\'s rude and will tear you apart on any assignment that you have to meet with her on, do not take this class, it is incredibly boring and pointless"
good course for novice and experienced computer users
"She gives out study guides for every section. Do them! Also go to lectures, not all the information will be in the slides or the readings. She has a pretty dry sense of humor, but I personally enjoy it. She\'s easy to approach and loves when people ask questions or come in for help."
TAKE LAUREL IF U HAVE TO HAVE HISTORY!She makes her class extemely easy to get an A. You do need the book b/c quiz questions come from the reading but she tells you the question the class b4 so that you know what to read for. Test are lengthy but she gives a great study guide.
Just wanted to say that this teacher is impossible to deal with. Do not take him because he\'ll make your life a living hell.
"Her essays are pretty easy, but she will not further explain the assignment. She gives you a prompt and you have to figure it out for yourself. She\'s helpful with grammar and rules, but can definitely go off topic like 90% of the time. She is anal about attendance and she is a bit rude so I don\'t recommend you try to add on the first day."
"Julia is an awesome prof! She really connects with her students. She\'s a tough grader on speeches. Also tends to rant. Has pop quizzes, but they\'re short and simple if you do the readings and pay attention in class. I used a voice recorder during classes, which really helped me for the final. Speeches: just do EXACTLY what\'s required and easy A"
Easiest lab I have ever taken. It was not very interesting but it is an easy A.
Various class activities. Charming personality.
"When Corrie handing back the grading she told my lab partners to ask me about the grading, even though I had no idea why because she never told me. I even almost broke out crying in front of the entire class and told her that I felt that she was biased towards me. In the end, she emailed me apologizing about not telling me my grade was lowered...."
"I loved! Professor Bruce, he\'s a great teacher and a great person"
"He is something else, could not wait to leave his class"
mediocre teacher and awful for advisement. will advise you right out of the major. just all around mean person.
"Not many tests. Assigns weekly writing assignments that he grades at the end of the semester. Lectures are interesting and he takes participation points and attendance. There is a huge 45 min group presentation at the end of the year. Fair grader. Doesn\'t provide a study guide, rather a general outline of possible topics. Says ""right"" every 5 secs."
Cheryl is probably one of the easiest professors at Cuesta. Its an interesting class but it gets boring and repetitive. Important to go to every class. She is very understandable. Easy credits.
"Even though attendance is not mandatory, GO!Also, PAY ATTENTION or he will put you on the spot.His grading method is crazy, but he gives students multiple chances to improve.The final WAS 50% of the final grade,but he gives huge grade curves because his wording can be confusing.I learned a lot but it was mostly due to studying on my own."
"I took Prof Rhea in a maymester and it was my favorite class I have taken since charging my major to business. He\'s very understanding. Grades you based on if your work meets the requirements, not necessarily the thought. He knows you have an opinion and respects that. 5 quizzes 3 test 3 case study(EASY!!!) and a group proj 20 pgs. Project is easy!"
GOOBACK!!!!
Ummmmm.......If your interested in spending and hour and twenty minutes wacthing a man find and correct his mistakes. THIS IS THE CLASS FOR YOU.
"Such a great and genuine person. SHE IS HILARIOUS! And she honestly cares about her students. I would not consider this class an ""Easy A"", but the material is definitely ""do-able"" if you just DO your work. Great teacher!"
One of the brightest and best professors I\'ve ever had. Expects a lot but teaches to match.
"I Love this teacher. She is Real, Down to earth and very professional."
"She was an awesome teacher! I took her online. Any questions I had I got an answer from her within the hour or two. Her work wasn\'t hard either, you could get it finished and even work ahead and have it all done in a few hours. She was so helpful and worked with you. I would definitely recommend her!! If I could take her for every class I would!!"
Dr. Fredrickson is the best. Seriously. Take her for 3003!
He is very good and talented in what he does...i love it because he actually came from France..and it was so much better having a professor that actually lived there and knows the language so well..he made my first semester of French the most awesome experience and i cant wait for the 2nd semester!!! I defintely recommend him!! yall will love him!
"I think Prof. Selby is a good professor. Sure you have to read and study and his tests are hard, but if you honestly put forth the effort then you will likely get an A or high B. Don\'t blame Prof. Selby, he\'s a good teacher and helpful. He is also funny and tells interesting stories. Go to class and study and you will get a good grade."
Was great to take Calc 3 from and I understand was also the best Prob & Stats prof to get
He is INCREDIBLY boring. Can\'t understand what he\'s saying at all. I would advise that you just read the text book and learn that way because sitting in his class will get you nowhere.
"Peralta is one of the friendliest teachers i\'ve had. Make sure to print notes and take notes during class, it\'ll help a lot. TAKE THE SI CLASS TOO, IT HELPS EVEN MORE. She is really understanding too as long as you communicate with her."
"drugs and soc control. Class was relatively interesting and easy. No textbook required, though there is an article to be read prior to each class. (some are short -5pg., others can be long - 30pg.) Levinson is very knowledgeable and easy going and there is a lot to gain by taking this class. Midterm, final and a research paper (8pg. min.) Easy A."
"discussion unclear, unhelpful in asking academic questions, overall poor teaching. More or less feels entitled to a paycheck for showing up without teaching."
"Best math teacher I have ever had. He takes the time to explain and gives you real life applications. When I took his class I had not been in a math class in over 10 years and barely tested into math assessment. Had to take a development math class first, but because him I went from developmental math to passing his college algebra class with an A."
"Funny. Challenging. Favorite writing prof, hands down."
"I took this class because my advisor told me Schultz was a good teacher and I am so happy I did. He knows what he\'s talking about, is funny, and really wants his students to succeed. I loved his class, even though the subject wasn\'t always the most interesting. Yes there is work involved but he is super chill and none of it is incredibly hard."
"Don\'t take her, she was mean,and she flies though everything,and thinks you get it.I ended up dropping the class, cause I couldn\'t take her anymore.She\'s the only math professor that doesn\'t let you use a calculator in class or on the tests.she doesn\'t review anything before tests and quizes, if you can avoid taking her do it"
Dr. Bennett is so nice and understanding. She is very helpful if you have any questions. Just an all around awesome professor! I have had her for two classes and would take her again if I could.
She was a pretty easy going professor. First exam is hard but after the first one exams are pretty easy. Give small extra credit through out the semester. have one small group discussion based on assigned article. lecture using powerpoint. One 15 page paper. Easy to talk to about grades and assignment.
Do not take this class with this professor!!! he is sooo boring and keeps repeating himself. you will learn more by not going to his class and reading the book instead.
"Love Dr. Esposito, the best instructor I\'ve ever had in A&P. His explanation are so simple, he really takes time and goes out of his way to help students to understand the material. I wish all my instructors were like him."
Excellent professor. Really interesting and really fun person. He likes to make people laugh and is always there to help the students. Take a class with ths prof if you want to learn alot and have fun.
pretty good prof
This is a fun and educational class. Kovach uses real life experiences to relate the topic for each week\'s lesson which made it easier to comprehend the material. She is down to earth and truly cares about her students and wants everyone to do well. Assignments are interesting & she gives thorough reviews before each test. I highly recommend her!
"Excellent instructor. Really chill but at the same time knows every detail of what hes teaching and teaches it to you really well. Hes not easy but if you\'re looking for someone who is going to make you an excellent pilot, hes definitely the one."
"He goes way off topic talking about his personal life and political/life opinions rather than the class material. Homework is limited. The hardest part of the class is making yourself attend for the participation points, but overall it is very little work."
AWESOME! i took this class as an easy gpa helping course and it did! he\'s awesome and the homework is simple. even though there\' sonly 2 absences he gives u 2 pts. if you don\'t miss any. great class and a great teacher
He is the worst prof I have ever had! he makes absolutely no sense w/ his stupid and obscure assignments. RUDE!!! UNHELPFUL!! and I feel as if my writing skills have decreased!!! oh and its a really boring class....has nothing to do w/ media and totally pointless. Do Not take his class!!
She is a very understanding professor. I learned so much in her class. She will always help you.
"Don\'t ever bother asking questions in class. She reads off er powerpoints and when you ask a question to better clarify a slide, her favorite answer is ""I dont know"". She doesn\'t enjoy teaching her class, she\'s only interested in Research and she literally told the class that"
Terrible professor. Doesn\'t lecture on topic. Review sessions for tests are a joke: ask him a question and he\'ll refuse to answer on grounds of not wanting to get that answer on the test. Only class I felt like not going to. Much of what is on tests he does not go over in class and expects students to study themselves at home. Great waste of money.
"Not at all clear cut. During her power point presentation, Professor Jac-Kucharski was distracted. The information was also not helpful for weekly exams. I had requested help many times and her response was study harder. If you struggle in the slightest this is not the Professor for you, this is a self-taught online class."
she was alright just not clear enough
Besides the fact that this is a tough class I would have to say that you learn a lot so its worth it. He is really strict on grading and loves punctuation. But he is a good guy who really wants to teach.
I don\'t have much to say about his teaching style or anything. I just wished he delivered grades to us in a timely manner. Seems he cares more about his doctoral student career than he does the actuall students he teaches
really great professor! his lectures are really fun and interesting. he\'s extremely helpful and knowledgeable. take him!!
took for intro & diversity class. very honest. very easy. must do 15 hours observation per class. dont forget to present a chapter and its a guarenteed A! Dr. B is very helpful been teaching since early 80\'s!!
"Please, save yourself the agony of this class. The hardest tests I have ever taken, and I am a 3.7 gpa student. The class averaged a D-F on every test and she didn\'t bother to say or do anything to help the class. She hands back test with 5 minutes left in class. Doesn\'t bother to go over them or anything. Never been so stressed out over a class"
"I loved Judy Hilton, and I am very disappointed that I will never have her for another class. She made class fun, and kept a very personal and supportive relationship with us all."
"Amy was always very nice. She is a good professor to have as she is very passionate about metalsmithing and jewelry. She really knows her stuff, as far as composition, process of a design and techniques and can fix everything in the lab."
"The class itself is awesome, she is great at lecturing and I love going to class. Just be aware that it\'s a very hard class. I study about about 8-10 hours a week just for this class and I still never feel prepared for any of the exams."
Prof. Caron is a great professor. She would take extra time to explain things you don\'t know. If you take her class be ready to do a lot of writing and reading. At the end it will be for your benefit because you will improve your writing skills a lot. If you don\'t do the work you won\'t pass. That\'s obvious!!!
"Dry. Hard to pay attention to. No sense of humour, shows videos from the 70s that are no longer relevant. Material isn\'t hard, but he makes it sound like it. Sort of mean."
"Has no idea how to teach a large lecture hall. The conceptual questions are what kept me from getting an A, don\'t skip class bc the slides he posts are no good. The math is not terribly difficult to figure out, chegg is needed for this course because he does not explain how to do the hw problems at all. But if u can master the hw the exams are ok."
"Absolutely amazing. I HATEED SCIENCE. Hate with an undying passion, but he made the material in basic science not only clear and understandable but helped me to improve my opinion on science skills and my opinion in my own abilities. He is incredible. TAKE HIS CLASS. You WILL NOT regret it"
"TV course was unbelievably easy. Skimmed the $8 textbook, memorized the study guide questions and got an A. Still don\'t understand why they call it a TV course? What broadcast lessons?"
She is a great teacher and very easy to get along with. When she gives a speech assignment she gives very detailed outlines that help tremendously. I came into her class with no public speaking experience at all and by the end of the semester I was able to give a 5 minure speech. She is a great teacher.
Lange is a good teacher. He is a very funny guy and probably one of my favorite teachers on campus. Helpful and class is easy.
Grades unfairly
"Um so I don\'t know what problems other people have with her, but Dr. Mullen is my favorite teacher. Not cold or rude at all, and she\'s got a great sense of humor and really cares for the welfare of all of her students, not just her coms majors. Her tests are pretty difficult, but it\'s an upper-level course. With half a brain you\'ll learn and love h"
"Dewhurst is awesome! I have never had another professor that was so excited to share her knowledge with others and actually care about them. She may be strict, but she wants people to understand that the material she is teaching you is in your best interest! If she taught all classes at EKU, I would have signed up with her every time."
"very interesting class. did all our work as ""small groups"" since it was small group comm course. learned alot i didn\'t know about dealing with group dynamics. class is a mixture of lecture & group activities. holly is energetic & upbeat - definitely a morning person! good prof, i\'d take her again"
"Beth is a very nice person. Having said that, this class is crap. You will (re-)learn how to be professional and ethics. Attendance is graded. There is a group project, mock interview, and the final is at a fancy restaurant. There is a portfolio, but that is just compiling everything you\'ve done in college."
"Professor Cottle is one of my favorite professors. He\'s very nice, but still challenging to most students. The way to get an A in his class: Print out the Comprehensive Study Guides, make flashcards, study them every day. I\'ll miss the class. He was a fun guy! But seriously, that\'s how you get an A - only a few kids did that AND STUDY SESSIONS HELP"
"if you want to get on his good side wear an I LOVE GERMAN SHEPARDS shirt to your first day of class. Stick to his outline,even if you think you can give a better speech or you will not get a good grade! Midterm/Final are easy if you have any common sense and listen to his lectures. I did feel more comfortable with public speaking after his class!"
"This class was an excellent introduction to public speaking. Seonah was not only very fun, using pop culture references to relate to students, but also caring and kind. She met with each student individually twice a semester to work on specific goals and gauge their progress. The grading and feedback felt very personalized. Very sweet and caring c:"
"Such a fantastic professor! Easily in the Top 3, if not higher, of the professors i have had at Kean. I am so happy i was able to get into her course. There are weekly quizes and 4 tests and a final. Studying is a must. Despite the work the class is fun and i actually enjoy attending each class."
I really enjoy Paul\'s class. He is patient with those who are unfamiliar with their gear and wants to be with you each step of the way on projects. You need to be in this class or you won\'t pass. Seriously. One thing to note is that it\'s good to sit in the front of the class because he is VERY soft spoken.
Mr. Story is a nice guy. He gives quite a bit of work though so if your taking this for an easy grade try somthing elese.
DO NOT ever volunteer anything in class she does not know herself. She will hold a grudge and subjectively reduce your final grade.
Difficult to understand. Doesn\'t give good examples in class.
"He is the worst professer I\'ve never seen! \r We shot the short in the class. He was shooting camera, but in most of his shots, we could see the crew working and the boom mics! AND, even in the OK takes! \r I can\'t believe such **** is a teacher in our college! \r I guess he\'d better restart from taking the VERY basic class of cinema."
"This is the best professor I have had at York. He makes a difficult subject easy to understand. His tests do not try and trick you as other professors do. If you can take a course with him, do so."
he is freakin HOT!!!!!!!
stimulated great conversation. lots of challenge.
"I loved this class. He made history very interesting. He is very cryptic in his instructions and tries to weed out the slackers so be on your game. Take good notes, and make sure you listen! I love it."
"GET THE BOOK AND READ IT! This professor is a kind and generous person but she does NOT bend on her expectations of you as a student. She\'s a fair grader and gives many chances to get a better grade. Overall, I liked her a lot. But you have to read to get an A! She is blunt, but not mean."
"He is a good teacher. all you have to do is your work and study.trust me if you just do what you have to do you will for sure pass with a B. i really learned a lot from this class, my vocabulary definitely improved. i would recommend."
"I agree, the best economics professor at McMaster, possibly the best professor period. It\'s a terrible shame he retired."
She is a really good teacher had her in summer one of my easier english teachers I have had.just make sure you come to class and not be late and you will do good.
"Anybody that bashed her pbly doesn\'t belong in college anway. Her class consists of 4 papers, no midterm/final,few journals that we dont even get graded on. I couldnt ask for a better professors, she even stays after class to offer help t anyone who needs it, consider yourself blessed if you get her"
"He failed me. I am sorry to say this, but he grades unfairly and without rhyme or reason. He also shows favoritism. Numerous other professors saw my work and said they didn\'t know what the problem was. They said I should have gotten an A or at least a B. I\'ve now taken several other English classes at other schools and aced them all. Go figure"
"Its true what they say about it being borrring and not being able to understand him, as well as it being an easy A. Good hearted man but I haven\'t learned anything useful in his class. The homework of the post don\'t make sense, and they are also boring. He should be teaching an esol class vs. sociology. I am glad for the easy A though."
Jodi is the coolest teacher ever. She is really fun & supportive. I would recommend her to anyone.
"I\'m a French major, and I\'ve been in upper level French classes since I\'ve been at WestMo. Schaneman is pretty awesome, but her expectations are really low for the upper level classes. My French has gotten worse since coming to Westminster, just because of the lack of practice and the lack of people who can actually speak the language here."
"Jill is great! I took her for a may session POM class and I really learned a lot from her. She was always willing to explain things more if you need them to be. She prints out the slides for you and tells you exactly what will be on the tests which is nice. The only thing I didn\'t like was her grading scale which was 96 for an A, 92 for an -A, etc."
She is a great teacher. She really took time on grading papers but she had great feed back. You will become a better writer.
"This professor really care about her students. She can be a **** when she wants to, but as long as you do ur assignment(as u should), and hand them in on time you shouldn\'t have any problems with her. Shes a great professor and i had a ball! SHE\'S GREAT"
I took her summer class and it was really hard. She would never tell you when there is a test. She will review a chapter and then take a test. You can call it a surprise test. If you ask her any questions she would not answer it. In other words she is rude. I think that she is not a good professor!!
"Rob presents the material well, but he does not give a lot of examples unless you ask him to. He is very willing to help if you need it. We had 2 exams and a group research project as our only grads. I highly recommend."
"As long as you pay attention and complete the online assignments the class is easy. I didn\'t read 1 page of the book. Just listened to her lectures and did online assignments. Lectures are boring but try to stay engaged in class, she is big on class room participation."
Outstanding Teacher Great Class
Class was very easy! graded heavily on attendance though. but you can just sign in and then walk out and you still get counted as attending. kinda hard to understand the teacher but funny guy. layout of tests were left up to class. very short term paper and oral report. easiest class so far at CSUF!
"Kutz is an amazing teacher. He jokes, he teaches, he makes class interesting, and the quizzes/tests are VERY easy if you make sure to come to class and look over the notes the night before. We\'ve had a lot of laughs in his classes..."
"Very dissappointed with the quality of the class. I expected to learn something...didn\'t, despite how hard I tried. Very unorganized. Expect at least a month to receive anything back, if you ever get it back. Will not answer outside questions regarding the class. Very difficult to get a good grade in the class. I would not recommend her."
"This class is so easy. Just do the work, and you will get an A. He is very helpful, and allows you to correct your work, but you will not get the full credit for corrections. Most of the work can be done out of class. I would take him again :)"
"really nice guy, will say what he thinks, very helpful, easy to listen to, lots of work but he lets you redo things you have trouble with and his due dates are negotiable"
"HARD class, very understanding professor."
he tells alot of jokes
Scott is the most awful professor I\'ve ever met in my life. He doesn\'t look at the syllabus or care to address your concerns. He\'d rather make a sarcastic joke than offer help or give constructive feedback. He\'ll tell you that everything is fine and even if you do all the work he\'ll fail you if he feels like it.
"The class is not too hard. But the guy is just annoying. I think he makes some things up in order to pretend to know whats going on. Trys way to hard to be likes by the class, but will help you out if you need it i guess. Take him if you need to, but his ways will get under your skin."
"I have taken him for SOC 101&102. He is a great teacher and person. Very funny and helpful. Super easy A, he gives you basically the test as a review so show up on review day. He does extra credit and is willing to help you get an A if you try. Would 110% recommend him!"
boring class but you have to attend. sign in sheet pretty much every class. keep up with your work and take notes in case you don\'t understand the assignment. no final. mid term was decently difficult. know the differences between argumentative/persuasive papers. helpful. pretty decent class.
"He is super nice, really cares about his students, and makes good jokes in class. Overall, he\'s a wonderful man ! :)"
"Brilliant professor. He can sometimes veer off on a tangent or two, but if you ask him to clarify, he will do a great job. Genuinely kind man with a wealth of knowledge to impart!"
Ed is the easiest computer teacher. The only thing about him is if you need help he knows probably as much as you do about computers.
hildebrand is a great professor. he explains exactly what he wants in his papers. only wrote 5 papers the entire semester and read one book. lectures can be boring... but important if you want to understand assignments. i VERY MUCH recommend this professor to anyone taking english 110!!
"Hard grader, arrogant attitude. Unclear instructions, many mistakes on handouts and on his own grading system. Disorganized."
don\'t rely on the powerpoints to help you pass the tests; you should go to class and actually pay attention. he can be boring at times but is very straightforward with what he expects with each assignment.
Absolutely Great Teacher. I had him a couple years ago but I still remember him well and I talk to him if I happen to see him around. He words everything to where it is very easy to understand and actually makes the class fun. Definitely one of the best math teachers I have ever had!
"Great teacher. She will make you work for your grade, but also works with you to make it better. I would take one of her classes again in a heartbeat"
Nice teacher with great intent but he has a one dimension teaching method that if you comprehend its very hepful. But I had to rely on other resources. Must do online homework or your grade will suffer tremendously. No homework interaction with students just tests. his test are complex and you must know your spanish well to pass.
"Jim is an extremely intelligent individual. However, his teaching style is graduate level. His introduction to theatre class was my first C. He relies heavily upon the text and grades hard. I would recommend a different professor if possible."
"Worst professor I\'ve ever had! She is unorganized, very prejudice, boring, and thinks her beliefs are the ultimate answertruth. It\'s ironic how she is supposed to be teaching an ethics course, but does not practice personal moral behavior. Also, DO NOT BUY THE BOOK. All of the readings can be found online in some capacity."
"Her stlye I must say is very unique. I would have to say that she expects way to much from students because she literally knows everything about anything. I find it hilarious how she pronounces all her words in syllabuls..se-cu-lar, du-ty."
"If you want to take a class that is self taught take her, she does not teach at all. you have to read the book to learn everything and then you do study guides every week that are for the quizes every week, then every month there is a practical that you have no idea what is going to be on it I dont recomend her. take someone who actually teaches."
"She was such a nice professor. I always hated giving speeches, but I felt much more confident and it is all because of her. I would highly recommend her because she makes you feel more confident about your speech presentations."
"Worst prof in the chemistry program at Ryerson. Very unorganized. Spent the first 3 months of class barely teaching new concepts, and then all of a sudden introduced so many 2/3 weeks before the final. Made it really hard to keep up. Go out of your way to avoid this prof."
"Dr. Lutzoni is a funny guy and fun to be around. He\'s always willing to help student both with in class stuff and anything beyond the classroom. Sometimes he can belabor a point, but it\'s clear that he is passionate about what he teaches, which makes his class enjoyable."
Great Prof. Lectures were very clear. She gave real world examples which really helps!
"thank you, I learned alot. and realy enjoyed this class."
"Jesse takes some getting used to and at first seems rude but he is a great guy, very funny and knowledgable. You get more out of the class if you engage him or talk to him about your interests/goals in the class than if you just attend passively. Gives great assignments."
"Logic is HARD. If you don\'t come to class, don\'t expect to pass. Pay attention, do the homework problems in the textbook, and you\'ll pass his class! He gives TONS of extra bonus points on exams though to help more students pass. Explains concepts thoroughly and goes over things again if you ask. Really great professor, but don\'t expect an Easy A!"
More difficult than I expected for a nutrition/health class. There is tedious work to be done. There is several lenghty assignments some easy some not. Do-it-yourself type of class. There are opportunities for extra credit. Tests are online so they are somewhat easy. Reading is a sort of a must and the chapters are long.
"Online course does require a weekly quiz to be done. Since it is online, when you read the chapter you have to be real careful because she gets super specific about detail since its online and you are not allowed to use the textbook, everything you learn should be based on the book on the tests. Read closely and put good input and you\'ll be fine."
"there is a direct correlation between days when she wears her hair down and days when i can\'t concentrate on the material....oh, and it\'s interesting and well structered, no surprises...."
"The reviews for Dr. Luma are clearly from some lazy and disgruntled students. I took him for Honors Intro to Am. Gov. Few things: you have a project to do for the semester, two tests (midterm and final) so grades are straightforward. Also, he tells you everything that will be on his test so you\'ll be prepared. Never needed the textbook bc of this."
hands down the best math teacher. Don\'t be afraid to go in for help during her office hours. she explains things very well and she is not intimidating at all. I absolutely love her.
"Ok so after reading other\'s comments I feel the need to defend Prof K. He loves philosophy, and it shows. He knows what he is talking about, and assumes you as a philosophy student is somewhat more intelligent then the average student. He is so smart it is super sexy. If you get lost, just talk to him about it and he will help you."
"I\'m going to be honest. She is a nice lady . This class solely depends on how comfortable you are with math. If you\'re good at it, then most likely you\'ll be fine and get a passing grade. BUT, if you ever struggled with math in highschool, do not take this class. She expects you to get and understand the material the first time and doesnt review."
"This Lab class has absolutely no instruction from the the teacher and so the labs can be very hard to do. He is a very very nice person, but a tough grader. Considering this is a lab 1 unit class he grades hard and expects a lot of right answers when a lot of the labs are guess work. We are not GEOLOGISTS! We can\'t be expected to know THAT much."
"Dry, mundane lectures. Great class overall, because of Leveau\'s lectures. Doug had a few gems, but as a professor I didn\'t enjoy his style of showing a slide with one picture on it, then talking about it for 10-15 minutes. Would recommend the class, but Doug\'s lectures find me asking for more and confused about what Im supposed to learn."
Really great guy and straight to the point. Fair grader and makes speaking in front of the class somewhat easier. Very easy going.
very very hard teacher and doesn\'t explain much
He\'s a great professor. You do have to go to class and get the book. cares about the students and makes sure everyone passes. He\'s an excellent guy and you will learn a lot! Just do the learning journal! Makes some lectures light hearted and fun but super lecture heavy!
Dale is a sarcastic and funny professor. He is always ready to make a light-hearted joke out of anything. He is always wanting the best for his students and willing to help and answer any questions. The only thing that can truly kill your grade is not turning in the online assignments.
"I took French for 3 years in high school and if i wouldnt have, i would have failed this class. He teaches the class like you know fench already. If you are looking for an easy A...this is not it."
"I took him for History of the 20th Century. Great guy, smiles all the time really loves his job. One of my favorite teachers/persons I have met at MCC."
This is not a hard class but the teacher makes it very hard and boring. nothing against the teacher. She was a bit disrespectful to many of my classmates and I occasionally saw her retaliating against some of them because they needed lots of help from her. Her criteria are very confusing and disorganized. and this makes everything hard and tense.
"Worst teacher I\'ve ever had in my life. Talks slowly and then slowly writes what she JUST said up on the board...for only god knows why. Three hour lectures DRAGGED in her class...luckily, I have her again next semester! YES!"
"Hes a sweet and nice man. I took him for my GIS The class is boring, but interesting once you start grasping the material. It\'s very easy to pass, yet be aware you cannot mess up on the (open book) quizzes given. That\'s pretty much what your graded off of along with participation & a project regarding maps at the end. Hes more than willing to help."
"Nic is a really cool teacher. He is pretty funny, and makes class fun. Extremely laid back. A lot of class is spent joking around. He doesn\'t give out that much work because he doesn\'t want to have to grade it, so tests are a big chunk of your grade. But if you study even a little bit and understand what he talks about in class you will do fine."
One of my favorite professors at UD. So helpful and the nicest person you\'ll ever meet.
Great Math Teacher I hated math before I came to class and he made me enjoy learning math. He made math interesting and more enjoyable. I would take him for all my Math classes great professor...
"Very clear, understanding, helpful, knowledgeable, intelligent. Always willing to help. Very nice and friendly. One of the smarter young professors I\'ve had. Will help you improve your writing."
"Not a bad teacher, grades his tests fairly. Is often available to help. Rushes through lectures though."
"Great guy, hard class, but very willing to help."
make sure you go to class he has attendence points
Worst teacher I have ever had in my whole life of going to school. He teaches like a text book and is never really clear on what is going on himself. I have never been so lost as to how I should complete my assignments. He teaches an introductory course like you already know what you are suppose to do. Many students in the class were confused.
"Took an evening class that was a lot of fun. Usually dread ENG classes but Prof. makes it funny, interesting and stress-free. Highly recommended! Usually have to write at least 1 paper per week but it really isn\'t that much. One research paper is required and can only be 4 pages long. Piece of cake class but also really informative. Learned a lot!"
He is one of the coolest professor in OSU. Make everything clear and like to help his student. Take him!
She is an excellent spanish teacher who makes learning spanish very enjoyable.
He makes simple concepts into a maze. He messes up often. You have to be alert in case he messes up the math on the board.
Teacher really sucks. She can\'t speak english clearly
It\'s ok.
"After two classes with Benson, I was done with going to school for fine art. He still grades on attendance, which is against policy. He is also very chatty about non-art topics and does not spend much time actually teaching."
"Dr. Wheeler is awesome. I barely went to class and got an A. Really passionate about what he does. He posts outlines for all of the readings, so don\'t bother reading them on your own. He gives the prompts for the midterm and final in advance. Really great professor, would take again!"
Very clear.
"Ditto to the other post. He plays himself as a pal-around sort of guy at the beginning of the semester but is very aggressive. Large project demanding significant outside class time and fundraising. Textbook is useless, he\'s a guest professor in a way so you don\'t even have a chance to rate him at the end of the semester. Total pain."
"Old and forgetful professor. Keep track of your grades because he might lose it. Only way to reach him is via email, which he never checks so you are pretty much screwed if you need to contact him prior to class or exam. A nice guy otherwise but needs to retire and keep politics out of classroom."
"This class was very interesting, and I actually liked doing the readings and writing the papers. The GSIs grade hard, though. Attending discussion sections a must, going to lecture more important than doing the reading. He\'s VERY good at clarifying concepts in class. Overall: good! But sometimes tends to drone on and on....."
"Lots of group work, be prepared to discuss content with your peers. Dr. Berger is an engaging instructor with a wealth of knowledge. She is inspiring, insightful, and genuinely cares for the student\'s success."
"Professor Giberson made me learn stuf really good. His exams are fair but boring, and I agree with that other student who says his clothes are nice."
"Very tough professor, turned me off from Majoring in Psychology. Demands a hell of a lot from students and tests are the most difficult I\'ve ever had. Get ready to read for hours and hours and answer long essays. Show up to class or you\'ll never pass. Stay away from him if you can."
good clear teaching and explanations. she will clarify if you don\'t get it. Exams are what was taught in class. shes a bit hard to understand but you get used of her pronunciation after a while.
Not very helpful in explaining assignment directions clearly.
Ego-mainiac. Loves to show off.
I have taken several Electronic Technology classes with Professor Lopez and with what he has taught me I have been able to apply and succeed in getting the intern job with Technicolor. What I have learned through him I have been able to apply/recognize the concepts from class on/to the job.
"He is easily the best COR 100 professor. I will gladly take an A- in his class over that ""easy A"" in other classes. You learn a lot more about history and life altogether from his classes. If you\'re ready for college, than his class will be a breeze. Don\'t be intimidated- the workload is not bad."
There isn\'t a better bio Prof than Professor Pratt. She\'s fair and always lets you know what to expect.
"At First, I thought Jimmy(He hates being called that) was completely boring and the longest 50 min ever. That was the first day. As the class went on I found he was a hilarious guy. Poke a little fun at him he will give it right back. If you ask him questions he will say exactly what he wants, and the papers are fun and easy to write."
"This teacher is mean to students, laughs at questions, and unhelpful. He has been teaching advanced accounting so long, he forgets it is new to us. He needs a reality check by being forced to teach Audit for a semester. Tests are impossible to pass"
he\'s the worst teacher I\'ve ever had. He should be fired
you have to do a lot of reading for this class. but dr. batra is very helpful. very interesting class. take it.
a workaholic old man. he really knows everything in that class but you cant understand that well in the class. exams are diffecult
She\'s truly amazing. I wish she could be my teacher for the rest of my college career.
"I had Chad as a lab teacher. Most everyone was a freshman and he was not used to his students not knowing simple things. He was very strict and he made it more difficult than anyone could have made it. He knows spiders, but said himself he forgot simple science. If you get him for a lab teacher, be prepared to fail. He feels no one deserves a C."
"Best teacher I\'ve ever had. EVER!! He gives it to you straight. If you\'re looking for an easy A, you will hate him. If you want to be prepared for the next class, you will love him. He\'s extremely personable, and available should you ever need help. I also don\'t know where his side burns are, but I think they\'re kinda cute."
Seta is amazing. Such a smart and powerful woman. She is a great teacher and I learned so much in her class. Although the class was hard and had a lot of work it was all worth it and as long as you are a hard worker you will have no problem.
"She is very helpful outside of class, if you need assistance with translation or with course planning. Class moves slowly and is not very interesting, but she does like to take tangents in which she compares ancient situations to contemporary ones. Once she told us that a consul is like a someone from ""Battlestar Galactica."""
Best professor for poetry! Excellent personality!
Don\'t take the class just to take it. You have to take the best notes of your life and really dedicate time to learning the material. If you don\'t have a lot of time I don\'t recommend taking the class. 60 plus pages of reading per week and lots of material you HAVE TO GRASP! An amazing professor who really cares and wants you to succeed. RECOMMEND!
"Obviously, the previous commentor didn\'t read the syllabus closely and probably didn\'t attend class--thought he knew everything and didn\'t need to do the work. She is a great teacher. I learned so much from her classes. She has great handouts and she was very patient with every student."
"Zaknic is the MAN. He knows everything there is to know about modern architecture and he\'s funny as hell. He will rip your term papers to shreds though if you BS it because he writes books about the topics he assigns, but he\'s awesome."
"She takes roll everyday. Attendance matters. Seems to have a bad attitude toward those going into nursing, she rolls her eyes when you tell her you are a nursing major. She is very egoistic. Has many degrees and loves to mention them always. It is hard to get past her personality. She does offer lots of extra credit though."
"Dr. Majed is great. Always keeps me interested with good examples, clarity, and humor. Loved his course a lot. Attendance is absolutely mandatory. Definitely recommend it."
Goes above and beyond for her students
"Very helpful teacher, will stop what she\'s doing to help you. Not many REAL teachers out there. Thanks Mrs. Lewis."
PICK ANOTHER TEACHER ASAP!!!!ESPECIALLY IF YOU ARE TAKING THE CLASS ONLINE. ALOT OF WORK AND SHE THINK YOU ARE A MINISTER OR SOMETHING! ONLY SEE\'S THINGS HER WAY IN THE RELIGON WORLD.DO NOT TAKE HER!!!HFCC NEED TO GET ANOTHER WR TEACHER OR REVIEW HER ACADEMIC!
Professor McCoy is really nice. It is important to form a study group in this class. Do the homework because the homework will help you with her exams. You will have to study for this class. It is a statistics class people and stat is hard.
He kept his head buried in his laptop writing notes the majority of every class and if you had a question he makes you feel like you\'re inconveniencing him quite a bit. Getting him to explain anything in another fashion as to better comprehend it is almost nonexistent. I will avoid taking him as a professor for the rest of my math at Wright State
I found Lars to be very apporachable and helpful. Just an overall great guy. Did you try TALKING to him?
He posts his lectures online so you can rewatch making the assignments very easy if you put in any work.
"In my experience, Professor Jing is very helpful and easy-going. The main problem I had with this course was that there was always too much covered in each lecture, and TA I had didn\'t have enough knowledge about lectured subjects."
Great instructor. Most lectures quickly became free form discussions. Very good at involving students.
"A lot of reading assigned but not tested on. The tests were easy if you studied the slides. He\'s a good lecturer (if a little scattered), and you can tell he loves what he\'s teaching."
He is a good teacher but hes incredibly hard. Try to get a different teacher.
He is a very helpful person. I have his bio 001 class. Don\'t fall behind reading and read your lab before lab class. If u are falling behind he is very willing to help. Very approachable. Give extra credit which will boost your grade. He tries to make it interesting though I have no interest in bio. But he does a very very great job explaining.
"Amazing professor! Show up for class, read the book, and participate in class - the rest is down hill!"
"Jacoby expects students to do a lot of work outside of class, but this is no different from any other acct Professor. To do well, you must show up to each lecture even though its not mandatory. Jacoby is a really smart guy, but going to SI helps with reinforcing the concepts. overall, i highly recommend him- ask him about his convertible truck."
"AWESOME! material was sort of difficult sometmes but she made everything so clear and wouldn\'t stop till everyone understood. cutest clothes ever, nicest woman, and once you take this class you will talk about it all the time! my friends have to shut me up when they say something that has to do w/sensation perception"
"Two group projects due throughout semester. A ton of reading required. Tests are pretty hard. The class was very informational overall, I learned a lot. Main drawback for me was that exam weeks still consisted of a regular work week as well (exam plus 2 chapters plus discussion, etc). Slow to respond to emails."
He is sooooooooo funny.... he will stop class to talk about bruce springsteen all the time... or american idol and how he\'s hip because he watches it!
"I learned a lot from Joan, but she wasnt\' always 100% clear in what she expected. Overall, a good teacher."
"I\'ve never seen any professor more passionate about their subject than Dr. Sharbaugh. Whether you agree with the teaching in the lesson or not, she is willing to accept your ideas and provide respectable discussions on the topics you bring up. However, I feel like the class could be a little bit more difficult to get the full experience."
"Gave us an assignment worth 10%, that required everyone to have a textbook worth $190. Never made use that textbook ever again. Heard her saying once, ""If I was the program coordinator, I would make 75% the passing grade."" Too full of herself."
"Worst class I have ever taken. Lectures cover only the bare most materials of each section, and tests cover advanced material that you will never see in class. His tests ARE timed and anything he says that will be on the test is most likely not going to be on the test. Prepare to spend a lot of time learning outside of class."
"he\'s really easy and he reviews the day before the test almost all the questions in the test. Only require one speech and one skit in the class. However, he\'s really easy on grading these things as long as you put in some effort. Don\'t have to study much for the test, just read the notes and the summary in the book and you\'re good for the test."
"Leonhardt is a solid professor. Lectures are entertaining, he uses a lot of relevant info and examples. Tests are fairly easy if you study and read the text. The group project is fun as well/"
"Wonderful teacher. I actually enjoy going to class and listening to him talk. The textbook can be kind of confusing, but he explains the entire chapter in great clarity. You can make an easy A as long as you read, do his studyguide, and pay attention in class! Enjoying him so much I\'m signing up with him next quarter! :)"
"Gail is the best teacher I have ever had. Not only she teaches the material, but she helps you and guide you step by step. She loves accounting, so if you really have the passion for this subject you will understand why she wants that much from students. We learn accounting by doing, not by reading. I would HIGHLY recommend her."
"You have a journal to write after every online lecture. The journal is literally 100-250 words based on something correlating on the specific lecture and you have to choose an article based on current events. There is a midterm and a final as well, and that pretty much sums up the class."
"Very boring, talked too quietly and too quickly. The other reviews are spot on."
"Oh man! This was the most painful class I have ever taken, he was hard to understand and he read directly from his notes, tests were not like lecture - homework was on tests though. PAINFUL!!!!"
"Very willing to help her students!!!! Deserves more respect, takes to much crap in class!! Goes over notes a lot, which can be good!!!"
Good
"In ECON 1150, his criteria is: 20% on online quizzes (10 quizzes with 2% on each of them), 25% on Midterm 1, 25% on Midterm 2, and 30% on Final Exam. For the most part, he is a very helpful and knowledgeable instructor with a good sense of humour as well. I just wish he would give students more time to work on their tests."
Brantly is a very good professor she is very laid back and covers everything in lectures that is needed for the exams. The exams are not extremely difficult but they are all of your final grade and because of the grading scale it is easy to get a good grade but hard to get an A.
"DO NOT TAKE HIM, material shouldnt be this difficult, he gives a lot extra credit, surpise quiz,A LOT of hw,not worth it, try someone else, very confusing, n do not get the book, he reads of ppt"
"Dr. Robison is probably the best professor I will ever have. Her class is so interesting, it really isn\'t a typical English class. Psychoanalysis is the key and if you understand that, you\'ll pass with flying colors."
You better come to class or expect a B or lower for every class u miss after ONE. Be realy for a real workout-this is not a blowoff PE class. PS-She thinks she knows everything!
"Dr. Webb is an amazing professor. The material isn\'t easy and the tests are really hard but Dr. Webb explains things really well and keeps your attention with jokes while staying on topic. Of all the professors that I\'ve taken in M.E., I think he is simply the best."
"Very clear, helpful, and precise. Fun to be in. Once in a while tells stories relevant to subject. First week or two will seem very easy, but after that, things starts getting complex."
"Doesn\'t explain clearly, never got a test back yet. Very nice woman though....just wish she would explain things so a beginner can understand."
"I thought she was a nice teacher. All you had to do was turn in your paper and if you got a bad grade, you can just write down what you did wrong and she adds it to your grade. I got a ""D"" on on of her papers and I wrote down what I did wrong, I got an ""A""."
Very helpful Highly recommend this teacher. very quick on emails and if u had to would easily give u an extension on an essay
"I\'m impressed by Professor Bednarz\'s deep, infectious love of Shakespeare. Not only Shakespeare, but as I was pleased to discover, Homer, Milton, Dante, Flaubert, Conrad, and even more great authors. I enjoyed participation. I love him as a professor and educator. Only thing is, he doesn\'t like Falstaff. I do."
"Madame is amazing! I absolutely love her and her class. She takes the time to get to know each and every one of her students personally. She makes sure all of her students understand the material. Rather than a regular lecture, Madame brings the topics to life with projects"
"I thought he was a great professor. I am terrible at physics, but thought that the material and the way he taught it was easier to understand than 207. Definitely take it with him, it\'s a lot of work to understand sometimes but there are a lot of resources for help. Each exam only has 4 questions, so make sure you use old exams as a resource."
I loved him and his class. It\'s always so much fun in his class and you will definitely learn a lot from him. The only thing I don\'t like about him is his test method. We had all three tests in class full-time writing essays. I think its probably not a very good way to test what I have learned. Still he is a fare and funny professor.
He is a very knoledgeable and good professor.
"I fell asleep in half the classes and still got a 97 average. If you can\'t get an A in this class, something is wrong with you"
Seriously the worst class I have taken in college so far. He makes no sense at all and his lectures do NOT match up with the textbook. He has a book review project due at the end of the semester that is six pages long and it\'s TEN POINT FONT. For a 100 level class. I made a huge mistake in taking it and so many people told me not to. SAVE YOURSELF!
"editing/makeup and newspaper: violently verbally confronted me to tears after being late due to car accident, paid me to drop newspaper. He has a God complex, and is all around horrible to be around. Most of the students dont have jobs or other responsibilites; DONT take if you dont want to be told to drop all your classes and job to focus on his."
"He\'s a moron...he doesn\'t have any clue how to do half of the problems. I loved going to class and correcting his mistakes. You learn by teaching him the material. I learned a lot in his discussion section because of this. He trys his best, but he\'s not the brightest or most clear math professor."
"I actually like the class. Yes, the man has language limitations but wouldn\'t you if you did your PhD in China? Besides, Fan makes up for it with a very well organized classroom environment. Two tests, that are essentially a regurgitation of your classroom notes/quizzes and one project. Nice guy!"
"She is BY FAR, the most unorganized professor I have ever encountered. There is NO direction given for any assignment, and the ""study guides"" for her exams do not cover the material on the exam. WORST online class Ive taken. Very frustrating. DO NOT take her class."
Best teacher ever! Super interesting and a lot of fun. He has some of the best stories. I took this class twice because Wally is the best!
I think Dr. Hawkes was a very caring and professional professor. Big kudos to him.
"It is obvious she knows what she is teaching. She does require a lot of work, but she is an easy grader. She is very politically active and wants to promote others being active as well. Second half of the semester is awesome! Barely any work! Awesome."
"very cheeky...with his dry sense of humor. I thought him to be very funny in his way. The class itself was not to terribly difficult; studying necessary. He is very straight foreward in presentation and expectation. yepper, that is what I think :)"
"Prof. Bollens is definitely one of the best teachers at UCI. His classes are very interesting and you will learn alot. Class is difficult are requires alot of reading. Midterm/final are difficult, but class is curved. Definitely Recommended"
"Dr. Steen is amazing! She makes Biology interesting and she tells many stories to make it easier! She teaches off of powerpoint slides, and there are 4 exams. Lecture quizzes are also easy! Make sure to pay attention in lab and ask questions! If you study and participate, you are bound to make an A!"
"She seems mean at first, but after a week or 2 she is one of the nicest profs you will meet. The workload isn\'t too bad. It seems a lot when you read the syllabus, but it\'s all spaced out really well and a lot of group work so it gets split up between multiple people. The assignments aren\'t so hard either b/c they are based off what you major in."
she thinks she\'s super hot but she is a creative writer.
Snoooooooze
If your willing to do the work you will do great. She is willing to answer questions and assist you as much as she can. She is big on being on time to class and goes by the rules when it comes to assignments.
Bonnie blames her students if they do poorly in class. She doesn\'t take into consideration that maybe her method of teaching is the cause of the student\'s doing poorly in class. SHE DOESN\'T EVEN HAVE OFFICE HOURS! the only way you can meet with her is after class!
"This class was a complete disaster. Mr. Yates had no idea what he was doing, nor was he helpful at all. I would suggest taking this course with a different teacher."
"Great professor. Thoroughly explains everything, also encourages and answers all student\'s questions. I had no interest in philosophy and enjoyed attending this class. One 8-10 page paper, big deal it\'s philosophy, can easily be written. Freshmen take this class expecting a HS level class, don\'t attend, and complain all day. Tests are essays."
Dropped me after not turning in a test which was not due yet but because I had not made any progress decided to drop me even though it was not due nor over due.
he is very funny and knows his stuff. take him if you can!
"He is one of my favorite professors. Probably due to his theatre background, he was always entertaining to listen to and made all of the lectures interesting. He gives great feedback on essays/reflections and always grades assignments super fast. Most of the assignments weren\'t too hard. The direction was clear but be prepared to do the work!"
"He is nice. He gives open book tests. With open book tests you learn more, because sometimes you have read a lot for one question."
"What can I say about Mowrer that everyone doesn\'t know already?! The guy is an amazing teacher, but I\'d consider rather difficult. I take his classes for the experience of having him for the professor."
"If you are bad at writing papers, i suggest you don\'t take him. when he grades he is very specific and will take off for the littlest things. But on the bright side he does let you revise your paper(s) until you get the grade you want. he talks ALOT, and can throw alot of shade sometimes."
"Julie is a really good professor. She really cares about her students and her lectures are very interesting and engage students. The reading isn\'t that hard, but the class really forces you to think."
"Decent prof, fairly easy going. Tests relate to material studied, no surprises. Makes subject interesting, but be prepared to take a lot of notes!.Nice guy."
"One of the worst prof I\'ve had. Really dull lectures, lack of engagement. Doesn\'t use a textbook and want us to read notes that are messy. Never responds to my emails."
There was a LOT of work to do to cover everything in part because the instructions conflicted and I had to ask lots of questions to make sure that I was covering everything. Poorly designed course and she could have easily fixed it by paying better attention to detail. Unnecessarily difficult and annoying. Do not recommend.
"I disagree with what someone said previously: ""you don\'t learn anything; easy A."" If you want to learn something, you will. If you sit around because you have to be there, you can pass easily but you won\'t learn. Simple as that. But Ernie wants you to learn. This class was fun and interactive as well, which makes things stick in your head better."
"Her lecture is literally next to useless for learning and she gives hard tests. Don\'t skip/look online for homework and don\'t underestimate her kind, grandmotherly nature. If you believe her when she says ""don\'t worry about your grade"" you\'re done for. Read the book and review homework and lectures before tests, they are harder than she let\'s on."
Best teacher I have EVER had. Earning an A from Copeland is my lifetime accomplishment. I would take all of my classes from him if I could. I absolutely adore him. I have learned more from the man in two semesters than I did in 13 years of public schooling. I truely miss him.
I learned so much about my writing. An awesome class with an amazing prof. She is fair and helpful. Definitely recommended.
"Mr. Somers is an amazing guidance professor. He is very respectful, informative, Quirky, and HOT haha. You def will not regret taking him!! he does give small assignments but nothing to hard. its more so for your understanding and to help you in the long run. 6 ASSIGNMENTS IN TOTAL, one 5-7 min presentation and thats it! :)"
Must have prior painting experience to get good grades. Listen to everything she says and you will get an 80/
EFB 340 is the best class I\'ve taken so far. Castello prints out all the slides and is there for all the labs to answer questions. He\'s hilarious which keeps lectures interesting. Material is straight from slides.
"I absolutely love Dr. Randall. She gets me interested in issues that i normally would not have been. She does like to discuss things in class, so i wouldnt take her if u dont like to participate. she mostly asks you to write papers and responses and her feedback is helpful."
I learned absolutely nothing. Waste of time.
"Highlight of my freshman year. He keeps his lectures entertaining and interesting and cares that his students understand the information. Very accessible outside of class during his office hours and will answer all of your questions. His exams are tough but if you go to lecture and study for them, you will be fine! Cannot recommend him enough!"
Posts lectures on canvas which is nice. Added in quizzes last minute make sure you check canvas constantly. Only opens up quizzes for a day. Required you to buy the text book and then day one said we would never use it. Make sure you study for the exams. There was not a lab for this class.
"Shes a very good teacher and very nice. Its easy to recieve an A in her class as long as you do your homework, which is given every class but its pretty easy."
He is sooooo nerdy and has a weird face tick. But one of the nicest teachers ever. He made me really understand the brain and all its functions. I would take more classes from him if I could. He is easy if you study. I got an A+.
He is sooooooooo boring and I think he may need to go back to school to make sure he has his facts straight before teaching it to his students.
"Remy is cool. Go to class, do the readings, you\'ll be fine. If you skip class, you\'ll miss the quizzes and have no idea what is going on. Puts all power points online, tests are straight forward."
"The material was clearly presented in an organized way. The professor obviously cares about students\' learning and his classes are well put together. The reproductive system session is rather entertaining; he is certainly shy about presenting that aspect of biology, but in a nice way:-)"
This class changed the way I looked at race and class. I believe every American should take this course if you want to understand some of the big \'why\'s\' of American History.
"he is a great professor, very passionate about architecture& often funny. practice exam questions, notes and slides are online but much more is mentioned in lecture, though it can get boring."
She is not the best professor. I did not like the way she taught the class.
Great prof
THank you Professor Puchot! :D
Military Veteran and Military Chaplain. Does\'nt like students being late to class. Constant changes and adjustments to syllabus. Be prepared to READ from a minimum of three books in the Philosophy class. But does help students with grades if work is turned in. Hard on books but will help you on the grade.
sarcastic capricious often says he doesn\'t like people or believe in counseling yet he is the head of the department
"Joe Greco is one of the best professors I\'ve had at CSUF. His Global Risk Management class was interesting and he has plenty of real world knowledge to apply to his lectures. The grade was made up of weekly online quizzes, 3 tests (1 online) and a group project. He was accessible and very helpful to students both inside and outside of class."
he doesn\'t keep me interested at ALL. his lectures have too much information and it\'s unclear what he\'s going to test on. he\'s knowledgeable but boring.
"Lectures can get a little dragged out, but the homework isn\'t too heavy and he will help you if you need it. Pretty clear expectations. Really easy to talk to and approachable."
Getting better...
"very good teacher. she goes quite quickly on the notes, so u have to really concentrate to listen. the test is fair, just maks sure you do HWs and study her notes.she marks fair and quite helpful when you ask her questions."
"VERY easy A; however, don\'t take this class if actually wan\'t to learn something about the world\'s religions. He tends to drone on and on about nothing, and attendance is mandatory. To be perfectly honest, I used the time to do homework for other classes. But, if you need an easy A, it\'s a good class."
A really nice guy who tries to help as much as he can but he is very unclear. He goes off-topic a lot - giving us information that we don\'t need to know. Doesn\'t really go over the things we do have to know very well. Friendly guy though.
"Dan expects the best out of you. Very funny in lecture, explains things well, all around great teacher. Very caring and accommodating. Take anything you can with him, you will learn a lot."
"Took his online class. First day he assigns two 50 point quizzes that you are able to retake as many times you want. 3 discussions, 3 exams. the third exam is the final and worth more points. 25 questions per exam and is timed. Exams are very difficult you have to read every small detail in the reading to pass. DO NOT procrastinate with the reading"
You have to get used to his style of teaching. He assigns homework that can count to up to 25% on each test so you would be dumb not to do it. Usually spend the whole class going over homework because it is tricky. He wants you to pass and from what I can tell is a generous grader. He\'s very sweet and a pushover so please respect him!
"His assignments in CIE were hard to understand, and class discussions were worthless. He is a really easy grader though. Just don\'t take him if you want to learn a lot. And no... he is NOT hot."
Very easy marker. She just gives quizzes to take home and hand them in class. Easy to get A from her. Clear explainations. Easy to deal with. Interesting classes. Would rate her 8/10 :)
"Professor Afsaruddin was one of the most inflexible professors I have ever had. I took the course with absolutely no background knowledge and I fell behind quickly. You needed to have a background in Islamic philosophy and the Arabic language to keep up, but I did not. She was not easy to work with and made the course especially difficult."
"Dr. Gibson is really sweet but a very difficult grader! I did fine in her class, but this was definitely one of the hardest classes I have had at Maryville! She is very knowledgeable about the subject and has a true passion for what she teaches. I would recommend that you not take her FRS class unless you are serious about the topic."
excelent prof and knows his stuff
"She hands out outlines that give you the basic gist of the class, just take notes on what she says. Three papers (70%) a non-comp final (15%) and participation (15%) and that\'s your grade. The papers aren\'t too difficult and she is always able to help if you need it. You will learn! Great teacher."
"His online class is well-structured (inc. extra resources, I recommend patrickJMT on YT.) Im not a fan of most math profs Ive had at SEMO, but he doesn\'t tryto make the class harder/more confusing than it already is. Not too different from most math classes, just do the homework and remember basic alg rules."
"She is very sweet and helpful. If you ever don\'t understand something, you can ask her in class or in her office, and she will never treat you like you are stupid. She facilitates conversation in Spanish well too."
"Great prof, easy to talk to, easy tests, and easy assignments. And? You actually learn."
What a great teacher! She teaches with day to day scenarios so you are able to understand and relate. Take lots of notes and you do not need the book. You must study for the quiz and final.. I took her for a 6 week summer course. ahe is funny and makes class enjoyable.
He is an intelligent man but a horrible teacher. Thinks too deep into subjects and constantly exhausts subjects. Also a very hard grader. I have had to revise two of my papers so far and they were not horrible papers at all with few mistakes. Somewhat helpful but does not make himself clear about what he wants unless you see him in office hours.
"He rambles nonsensically and says ""umm"" ""err"" ""uhh"" a lot...he sounds nervous and jittery, and he makes the atmosphere uncomfortable. I ultimately dropped his class, since he wouldn\'t tell us what was on the test and that spelled disaster for me. Avoid this guy!"
"She is quite possible the most annoying and one of the worst teachers at this school. Boring and droopy in appearance, she should just stop teaching now. Nobody cares about her outdated scientific information that does not apply anymore to the physical world. I wish she would just stop teaching."
"Great professor. I really like her, but not the class so much. I thought there would be more writing, but its more about using technology, designing and critiquing websites and working in the MOO. Dr. R is helpful and fun, as well as knowledgable, but the book makes me want to poke my eyes out."
"Awesome teacher! Very helpful, very attentive, always prepared, quick to return grades, exams are moderately hard and she does everything she can to prepare you. Highly recommended!"
"Good teacher, easy course. Has personal experience, good stories. Just make sure to pay close attention to videos-test questions are hard in that area...but the rest of the test is easy and straight from lecture."
"I don\'t believe I have ever had a more interactive, personable, caring professor than I had with Prof. Heilman! His ""real world"" experience spoke volumes above & beyond the class & text information. This professor TRULY cares...not just about the material he is teaching, but also about every student in his class. SCHEDULE HIM!"
Dr. Mitchell is a great teacher. His tests are hard but they also ensure that you really know the material. Dr. Mitchell also really cares about his students. He will go out of his way to help you do well (i.e. stayed until 9 PM on a Friday helping us with a lab) great guy.
I took him for American lit. You have an essay type test for which you really have to study for. He gets into his material.You will actually finish the book which i have never done in any of my other classes before. He is very strict of taking role exactly when class starts .
"Terrible! I withdrew. He did try to help at times, but he pointed out those who failed his tests in from of the entire class which I thought was disrespectful and unprofessional."
"Her class was benefical for the teaching field, but personally i could not stand her. She is a marxist and extremely opionated and bias. If it is not her opinion or thought it is wrong. Thier is a lot of work, but it is just time consuming and not that hard. I would not take another class with her."
"He\'s an ok professor. Class is super hard, and you do need to do the reading before class. Pretty nit-picky with grammar, and grades at a 4000 level instead of a intro 1000 level.........really REALLY hard class!"
I honestly wouldn\'t suggest her as a professor. I took her class online and found it quite difficult to be successful because none of the questions on the study guide were ever on the actual test. It took her a while to reply to emails. She offered to connect me with a tutor but she never followed through with the offer. I was very disappointed.
She is an awesome theacher. All the tests are open book but she goes over the info before the test so you don\'t realy need it. She has a lot of group work so you will get to know your class mates. She is a must take!
This professor is the best. I think that it was sweet what his daughter Elizabeth said. I find it very amusing and sweet that a little girl would go through this hard work to say such nice things about her father.
"She was a really nice lady, but I found that she had a hard time encouraging discussion."
He\'s totally laid back but I don\'t know if it\'s because he doesn\'t care or he is just damn cool...
"i definatelly enjoyed her class...i admit, sometimes the notes were confusing but if you listened carefully to wut she was sayin, it all made sense...always, ALWAYS willing to help, easy teacher..t/f tests..(some say they had tricky question, but lets face it, thats the point of a t/f test:)) i would strongly recommend her"
"Very easy to follow, he has some good stories."
"Mrs. Bickford is an incredible teacher. She makes the subject very easy to understand; she breaks it down and teaches it. It takes a lot of understanding and outside work, but she makes the subject interesting and easy."
He\'s the\'s best teacher in the world
Horrible teacher ! who gives out a f + i mean what is that even suppose to be ! noone should get an f unless the assigment was not completed i dont understand ! plus he is not understanding and seems to always think that his class is the most important of them all! no consideration what so ever ! btw he is not cute idk why everyone keep saying this
Just an awesom and likable instructor. He cares and is very knowledgable on the subject. Likewise wish he taught all the PRL course.
"He was really good, but don\'t expect him to sit there and lecture the whole time, he is gonna expect you to tag along and join in the group discussion. You get 4 unexcused absences before he starts taking points off. His quizzes are taken in the testing center and gives u a whole week to complete it."
great prof. Nothing else to say
"Chill teacher. Easy Class. Easy A. Do your readings. He does have reading quizzes. He is kind of awkward. A lot of group work, peer review stuff."
Awesome. Cheerful and straightforward. No excuse for failling this class.
"great professor and all tests are take home, including the final. loves to talk about when he was a kid but he has a great sense of humor."
"El says the funniest things! He\'s always telling us we look like dead fish, stroke patients, or having a seizure. It\'s all really funny though. Plus the class is fairly easy to ace."
"Alright, so this guy is a wack job... He made the class extremely hard, and I should have ended up with a D, but somehow I ended up with an A... Don\'t ask me how, and I never questioned it, but I am so glad that I ended up with a dishonest A, but I don\'t care, I got an A.. this guys tests suck... and the book was hell."
"Had him for Kinematics of Machines. He doesn\'t use a book so you have to go to class to figure out what is going on. I\'d suggest getting the recommended book, I wish I did. He is very helpful for the final project though. He enjoys hard problems, so tests are had to complete with alloted time."
"Prof. Bates is a very nice guy and if you do the reading and come to class, you will do very well. Grades are based on 3 point quizzes every week, 2 essays, a midterm and a final. I recommend him."
"Somewhat unclear grading system. She\'s not all that helpful, but not too bad either. This is a VERY easy class though. I didn\'t even try in this one."
"This was the hardest class I have ever taken, but I have learned so much. Tom is a wonderful teacher and really pushed me to be a great student. You will do well on assignments if you pay attention and follow directions. He is very helpful when you have questions. It is very rewarding when you do well on assignments in his class! Love him!!"
Very interesting class on Asian American media. Fairly new professor at UW but she knows a lot in her field. Friendly teacher and awesome grader. :D
"Linda is an outstanding teacher who demonstrates enthusiasm for her subject. She seems to know college students well and is able to apply complex concepts into our daily lives. I\'m definitely a sleeper in class, but this lady is entertaining! Love her! Take Dickmeyer!"
"This professor seems more interested in discouraging than encouraging English students. Halfway through the semester, he spent a whole hour telling me I should drop the class. He told me he does this with every student whos grades appear to be grim. Before that he made fun of me by pointing out that I wasn\'t paying attention instead of answering me"
"Stoddard is the best Professor I have had at Clemson so far. She is funny which makes class fun, and she genuinely care about her students . It is an easy class with easy material. There are no study guides so it is important to take notes, but tests are not hard as long as you pay attention in class and look at your notes before the test. Easy A."
"Marin is a great teacher. Must attend every day in order to get notes - tests are 99% from lecture. Tests are multiple choice and difficult, so be prepared. Class is somewhat dry and hard but if you work hard you can get an A. Don\'t miss any assignments, at any cost."
"He is a terrible teacher for a basic level he expects that we don\'t have any other classes to take so he gives a ridiculous amount of notes online. This class is a joke I would rather take someone else, but he was the only one teaching this course. He expects you to understand things that only a science major would understand."
"Riiiight, riiiight. The guy loves to listen to himself talk, and he doesn\'t often listen to anyone else. If you get lost, you\'re on your own because he won\'t take time to help you understand. The guy teaches Ethics like J. Evans Pritchard explains the greatness of poetry."
One of the most fair and honest men I have ever met. The man know more about history in his pinky than I will ever know my whole life. I owe much of my success to him.
"I found the readings great, just like the very nice professor. The final exam was fair and imaginative. I wish there were more like them."
"Can\'t believe I wasn\'t picked on because I am an Arts student. Even though I am an arts student, he made everything so clear and easy to understand!"
Great professor. Very intelligent and down to earth. All you have to do is ASK for help. Dr. Asllani students to actually learn. As long as your are learning and showing him you are learning then your grade clearly reflects. AWESOME PROFESSOR!
She is a great teacher and she will help you. Mrs. Schafter gives plenty of time to do the work assignments and still takes up work even after the dead line. I really loved her class:)
"Nice enough lady, however the class was miserable. I thought I would really enjoy a class about american writers in paris but it was honestly awful. Don\'t take it! She is also crazy strict on grammer."
Great teacher! His talents are under-rated. He is quite an accomplished composer.
Mitch Miller is one of the most inspiring teachers I have ever had. His passion for Greek philosophy is contagious and his lectures are completely engaging. wonderful. wonderful. do it.
"GREATEST PROF I HAVE EVER HAD! This class should be taken by everyone if they can, it\'s so fun, this guy is amazing, I love him! He is really nice, easy, and tells these great stories all class period."
Great teacher! He makes everything very simple. Goes over homework\'s in lectures so always watch them! The lectures are gold and need to be watched. But they are boring. Nights I couldn\'t fall asleep I would turn on a lecture and in 7 minutes I would be out.
Online. No text book. Watching three movies and read some articles. Weekly discussion board assignments and two 5 pg papers over the semester. He was a little flighty with communication but he meant well and sent informative and thorough responses on work. Just do the work and do it thoroughly and the class is pretty easy.
"This class was great! I am a combat veteran with a disability, and professor Bergman went above and beyond to accommodate my needs. I decided to take this course because I knew nothing about Russian history. I finished the semester with an A-. Learned a lot and had fun. He loves dogs! And he is genuinely a good person. Take this professor!"
"Class is so easy, and labs arent even mandatory, you can finish them before hand and turn it in and leave. Quizzes are open book. Easy A"
"She is disorganized; doesn\'t know how to manage time in class (half of the chapters weren\'t covered);doesn\'t know to answer to questions; goes blank. She explains absolutely nothing; just reads power point(misspelling, repeated slides, mixed information from different chapters, typo errors (including medication names)"
"Andrew is awesome. In our class, the first week and about the first three courses are basically philosophy 101; he teaches about life and what it means and why, the who, how etc. But his lessons are great, his idea of having 4 people to a table, one recorder, one speaker, and two other mini jobs is amazing, I recommend him highly. 9/10"
"Really nice guy, though he has his bias against your writing. He\'ll tell you it was a great, awesome paper, then give you a low B. Ask him what to do better, and he\'ll give vague generalizations."
Great teacher
"No office hours, lives in a different STATE. Extremely complex schedule for assignments and quizzes, with little flexibility for errors. AVOID AT ALL COSTS! If you need american lit to grad from HS....take it THERE! BCC probably will never have it on campus again so running start students beware! Don\'t put this class off!"
"Doctor Green is a wonderful Professor, her lectures are fantastic. You really learn a lot. I would definitely take her again."
"She is a Phd. however she can\'t teach. She is absolutely im-profession as a professor!!! She is really rude to students. We only have one midterm and one final to determent our grade for the entire semester, no extra credits!!!"
By far the best english teacher i\'ve ever had. Always willing to help students with their papers. Easy to understand and wants her students to do well in the class. Highly recommend taking her class if available
"Tammy was a great teacher, she gave great feedback and made lectures interesting. She is willing to help you any time you need it and is a pretty fair grader as long as you show up, do the work, and put your best foot forward! She\'s also very understanding to real world problems! Love her!"
"While everyone else was flipping through textbooks in their Jour 1000 class, I was WRITING a textbook with my group for Dr. Welch\'s class. One of the best experiences ever! It was very cool. He is full of ideas and extremely creative, plus a ""nice old(er) man."" I would recommend him to EVERYONE!"
"I was literally crying thinking about taking a speech class, but taking this class with Dale was really fun and made me actually want to go to school (the first time this has ever happened for me). I really enjoyed this class and I look forward to having him for every other class he teaches that I need to take for my major!"
"Very lenient grader. He can be very boring, so be warned."
"class is so easy if you just take your notes and show up. seriously thats all it takes! plus shes very smart, funny, and kinda hot. i loved her class."
great prof! great lectures
"Loeb really likes mathematics; I think he doesn\'t always realize that his students don\'t. Discussion sections are very important for learning the material. He really focuses on theory over examples, so make sure you understand it."
GREAT. One of the best Music Ed. teachers at BYU.
"I really liked this professor because he made class interesting, which made me look foward to going. He is really friendly and very outgoing. He is a pretty easy grader if you are a good writer, but does give a good amount of homework. However, I would definitely still recommend him."
"Very shallow. After two minutes of her innane pronouncmenet, I felt like I was back in junior high."
Lepkowska is an attractive middle-aged woman whom i would like to take out to dinner sometime.
She\'s interesting and makes class fun. The exams are essay and short answer and aren\'t too bad if you study in detail. Overall I loved her class!
"She is wonderful! Not strict, easy grader, funny, nice, and a great teacher!"
The best Spanish teacher I had while at this school. He is very fair and talks in both spanish and english which helped me understand the material better. Just study what you go over in class and you should do fine
"I hate WebAssign. Take her class and so will you. It\'s for the weak and lazy. She, unfortunately, seems to be both."
"If you want an easy A, take the class but don\'t expect to learn anything. He gets easily distracted and jumps from one subject to another and you can\'t follow him. Don\'t buy the book you don\'t need it. He teaches from life experience. Besides that he makes you laugh or puts you to sleep!!!"
"If you get her good luck, she\'s tough and won\'t really help you that much. Not understanding at all and is sometimes very rude. Very strict, so strict we had a seating chart in college."
"This professor always talks of subject. Knows what he is talking about, but lacks office hours fitted for certain students. Great personality, but stuck up. Doesn\'t clearify on what to do for homework, grading is difficult. Never seems to care for people in the back of the class. Lacks explanation on subjects and questions"
"c\'est du bonbon...ces travaux et examens sont pas faciles, mais j\'ai tellement appris dans ces cours...il nous tien en haleine tout au long de la session"
"If you perform under pressure, then she\'s the one to opt for. She appreciates hardwork and also gives bonus points. She\'s also very helpful; the condition is a will to learn. I had the most fun in her class. She is a no nonsense teacher, so if you are looking for an easy A, look somewhere else. You have to earn the A in her class. It\'s worth it!"
"Hated this class. Textbook material was extremely dry. Basically no lecturing. Midterm was realllly hard, no study guide, had no idea what was going to be on it. Dr. Ta is incredibly sweet, really funny, loves what she teaches. Hard to relate if you arent Asian."
best prof at psu!
"Great guy. Really patient and seems to care about his students. Answers emails quickly and very thoroughly. Tests were fair if you studied. He kept my attention in lecture pretty well, always up for questions and on-the-fly ideas. Even if students were wrong and tried to argue that he was wrong, he was nice, patient and really tried to help them."
"Dr. Fisher gets a bad rep because people aren\'t willing to work for their grades. I had him as an undergrad and then again as a graduate student. Honestly if you do the readings and make an effort to contribute to discussion, you will be fine. He just wants you to get something out of the course. He is very passionate and intelligent."
"You will never find a more inspiring, more helpful, more complementary professor. Dr. Deering is the best professor I\'ve ever had. I looked forward to going to class every time. I would retake it in a heartbeat. HIGHLY recommended!!"
"Had two classes with Mrs Spicer, She is one of my favorite instructors when I was at WCC. I would recommend her classes to anyone."
"David Bush was a good professor who had a good sense of humor that was often filled with ""dad"" jokes. Grades were mostly dependent on tests and quizzes with a couple essays as well. He enjoys what he does and thrives in it."
Professor is full of knowledge! He has done great work developing his texts on classroom management and special needs students. Recommended!
He is a great person to work with!
Hard Marker
VERY GOOD TEACHER
"horrible. assignments that were supposed to be posted on the weekends ended up being posted on wednesday. Instead of the 3 assignments he told us, he posted up 7. They were all due in 4-5 days. All during our midterms too. Also, the business lab program he askes us to use, is very glitchy. Many problems arises from it"
"Excellent professor. By far the best professor or teacher of politcal science i have ever had. Makes the class easy if you pay attention and study, and lots of extra credit. You will learn much about American Politics. Very friendly. Defenitly reccomended"
"he is alright. one thing is that he\'s always late, and cancels alot. but he is ok. the workload isn\'t bad."
"Prof Brown is a really cool guy. Interesting lectures and he has every note you could ever want available. Timely responses. The textbook is actually very interesting, but you could get away not reading it. Fast paced but doesn\'t feel like he\'s rushing. Grading is super clear cut, no surprises. Funny and enjoys talking to students outside of class."
"One of the best Finance Teachers I\'ve had at USC. His lectures are very interesting and he really knows his material. You can\'t just memorize formulas and facts in this class like many other finance classes, but it\'s an easy A if you put in the effort to truly understand the material."
Great professor! It is never boring in his class.
"Nice lady. She is a tough grader (I think only one person in my class received an A) and her lectures are a bit dry. Also, assignment dates are hard to keep up with, so try to stay organized. And don\'t buy the text book! You don\'t need it!"
"She is the best professor I have ever had in my life, besides that, she is an absolute great advisor. God may keep her forever."
"Comp II was a required course, and I didn\'t really want to take it, but she made some of the boring reading assignments more fun. Be prepared to do a lot of writing. I really liked all the group work and computer access. Good class over all!"
"Exceptionally knowledgeable, and humorous !!!"
I enjoyed his class.
"Good class, I took it online and learned a lot!"
"I don\'t know why people are complaining. Rostami is the best calc teacher ever. Math isn\'t really my forte, but he helps out the class a lot by going over homework problems, quizzes, and tests. If you still don\'t understand, go to his office for extra help; that\'s what helped me in Calc I. Funny guy too. Make sure you do the homework though."
"i hate this class. but lets be fair. the class is a pain and annoying, but we can\'t blame her for it. writing 5 page papers and analyzing readings will never be enjoyable no matter what the teacher does. expos is the class you get to complain about and suffer thru."
awesome professor with fair and clear grading criteria.
"well i don\'t know what everybody else is talking about; i had a great time in american art history. she\'s really open to helping people with papers and unterstanding the articles and other material. definitely not the hardest class i ever took, but if you\'re not the greatest writer you will have a hard time in her class and the dept. in general."
VERY EASY.boring lecture but you\'ll get a good mark.
Chazzy Bear is a hottie. I just wish he was a better teacher. 300 slides per subject is overkill. SLIDE MANIA WILL BE YOUR SAVIOR
She\'s the worst physchology professor I ever had for 102. In 101 she\'s easy but she\'s harder in 102. Take her for 101 not 102!!
"From what I have heard from other students, and I agree, this is the best professor to take End-User Computing with. He assigns all the assignments at the beginning of the year along with a suggested schedule for completing them, teaches you how to use MyITLab, and then lets you work at your own pace."
"A truly inspring woman, Mari brings performance art to life. Don\'t be fooled by her caring nature, the imagery she presents through her work can bring even the toughest soul to tears."
"It was an easy A, though you have to go to class because she will have you do a group assinment almost every class, though its worth an easy 10 points.she does read from her power points, and the book is sometimes needed for extra credit questions otherwise I did not read it. not a bad class at all, though a little boring!"
He is very good
"I think Dr. Soya has a great attitude, cares greatly about her students, and is willing to help when help is needed. The class is fun and interesting. If you follow along, you will have an easy time. Great class."
"If you are looking for a people person, run, far away. Uses her age and knowledge as a justification of putting herself on a pedestal. Very unhelpful, and loves to scare people."
"He clearly cares, but he is not on top of his game. He often gives out FAR too much homework and then apologizes for not realizing (you still have to do it though). The class has potential, but I would not recommend him as a professor."
"Most awesome prof! Accounting isnt all too entertaining, but I enjoyed this class. He tries to be funny and entertaining and at the same time you learn a lot. He made accounting easy to understand and enjoyable. Dont miss class though, it\'ll kill your grade. Class isnt easy, but its good. I thighly recomend taking Krause."
"I am not good at Math whatsoever, I have never before rated a teacher. Although because I am so bad I decided to help others like myself and say this teacher is NOT for the Math disabled. I\'ve cried over this class. My mom and dad paid out of pocket bc I am taking it during summer. She is quick paced, no 1 is doing excellent."
Heather is the best. Great class!
"Although it might have been the class I took her in, with mixed reviews going into class, I ended up really enjoying having her as a professor. Made sure to be clear and answer students\' questions entirely. Work load was very manageable, and a lot of opinionated writing. Class were pretty boring but how many classes are exciting to go to."
"AMAZING! One of the best professors I have ever had in my life. Never gives up with his students and if you have a problem you can always approach him. More than once half of the class did not have the homework and not once did he get mad, he moved the deadline. Suuuuper nice."
"Not bad, gave 5 homework assignments. Midterm was take-home (albeit very difficult) and final was open notes. Very, very generous curve at the end."
Good teacher...
took her for cross cultural... I loved her! she is sweet very well spoken and flexible... gave us a take home final.... I actually learned in her class.. you must be present daily so u can do the journals! ... Take her!
Rick is the most caring teacher you\'ll ever meet. He is the only one in this whole program that i would break at a stop sign for. Rick is a genius but he doesn\'t understand some of the concepts you throw at him sometimes. One of the great designers of his generation.
If your looking for a medically geared class take this one he is very good.
"Just like any other professor, she is a professional. The required assignments is to help with the students (my) future work. Referencing the completed assignments helps makes the current required work easier. If a question is asked, it will be answered. Good instructor, learned a lot of useful information."
"You will LOVE Karen! She truly cares about her students. Good amount of readings, but It\'s all to help us in the long run in becoming great journalists, and that\'s exactly what she hopes to accomplish with her classes."
"Beth is the best! She explains everything and she is available all the time. Must take every quiz and exam. Do not miss! It is hard to catch up. A lot of info...very little time. I have survived Micro and I can tell you if you have to take it, take it with Beth! She is the best! 2 written assigments, and she quizzes of her notes!"
"She\'s fantastic!!! You\'ll learn a lot, take her, she\'s hilarious. 10/10 recommend"
awful
This class had nothing to do with anything. You can go to class and not do anything to prepare and still pass by learning NOTHING! She plays favorites.
Absolutely the worst teach at Kutztown.
"This prof. was one of the worst I\'ve had. She didn\'t give clear instructions for how papers were to be done and she didn\'t grade everyone the same way (has favorites). Plus she was extremely rude when someone would ask a ""stupid"" question and would make fun of them in front of the whole class. There were a lot of assignments, so be prepared"
"She is the best speech professor @LACC, I took 2 semesters with her, she gives 2 presontation in on semester, 1 is personal, and another one is group work... it,s very simple, and u may get the whole point if u try ur best, midterm and final is very easy. if U memorize the handout she gives, u can get an easy A in her class, take her!!"
everyone got scaled down. The prof must think first year students are dumb because her assignments and exams are so easy. Took a long time to mark exams and even longer to submit marks. Never reply her emails. Classes were extremely boring. It\'s really too bad that the prof don\'t care because the course material is actually pretty interesting.
This guy is sooo nice and helpful!!! Tests are easy & you can even bring in a cheat sheet...very easy A...take his class!!
"Doesn\'t teach for the most part. Messes up on homework constantly which makes it hard to grasp the ideas. Seems to not really care whether the students do good or bad in the class. Tests are homework questions, but his grading is inconsistent so if you feel that you deserve more credit on a certain question, it\'s probably because you do. Avoid him."
"Very intellegent, but very hard to get a clear answer when it comes to assignments. Grades very hard."
"Professor Potter is a great teacher. Although the information is simple and easy, this is definitely not a \'bird\' course because there is a ton of information to know. But, if you study effectively and frequently your almost guaranteed a good mark. Importantly, you do NOT need ANY background in history to do well in this course."
Very nice professor and greatly cares about his students. Class is very boring however and the it was painful to sit and watch the time tick by.
"Really enjoyed his class. He tries to give all students individual help and is a great professor. For programming, he put all the lectures online, so you didn\'t really have to pay attention in class and could just look through the lectures. I would definitely recommend him."
She\'s the best! She\'s so helpful and knows what she\'s talking about. She makes her class interesting and it\'s enjoyable to learn. Definitely take her
"Chow is amazing! He is young, inspirational, and truly cares about his students! He gives great tips on how to be an awesome teacher. He is young and in tune with new technology and allows computers in class"
"Dr. Bob renewed my interest in psychology. When I first enrolled in Capella University, I was apprehensive and doubtful with my ability to compete a graduate degree in psychology. Dr. Bob gave me confidence I needed to move forward."
Grades hard.
Very knowledgeable!
"Karin is an awesome teacher. One of the best ones i\'ve ever had. She takes the time to help and is always there. Her tests are hard, but she grades very fairly!! I would recommend everyone take her if you can."
"Loved her, one of the few classes I looked forward to. Will always work with you if you need help or forget something. If you take her, be prepared to laugh, she is very fun!"
I never thought I\xe2\x80\x99d like Shakespeare until I took his class!!!
"Ms. Golberg-Wilks is competent in the subject of philosophy. I was a little concerned at the end of the class when we really had no feedback about our assignments, and the final was frightening, but I did manage to get an A in the class. I would recommend"
"I\'m a fairly educated man and this guy blew me away. The depth of his wisdom is staggering. A college professor with true style and elan. ""We dream dreams of grandeur; of greatness . . . ."" He is truly one of the greats. Take him for everything and you will wish for more."
Dr. Y was my absolute favorite professor at BYU. Her class changed the way I think about a lot of things. I have never been so excited about reading a textbook to attending class. My fiancee and I would literally read the textbook out loud together. She is a genius and knows what she\'s talking about when it comes to research. Go to test reviews!
"Although lectures are confusing due to the amount of material that needs to be covered, don\'t sweat it. Go back home and do the Webassign homework, go to tutoring if you dont understand it(MAJOR KEY) and DEFINETLY look at the Test Reviews she puts on D2L. They are really similar to the tests and if you do those, you should get a 90+ on every test."
"He is a very good teacher, he did a lots of prepare work"
"Great guy, terrible teacher. If you are already proficient in math, take a class with him. If you struggle with math, need help, can\'t understand a moderately thick Italian accent, and are prone to nodding off in class, avoid this prof."
One of the best professor at KBCC. She took a hard course. And made it fun and easier to unserstand the basics. Take her you wont. Regret it. She also gives you a chance to go over the homework in class and a very good review sheet for. The exams.
"Largier is extremely knowledgeable. He is approachable, kind, humble, and humorous. You will not regret taking his class. His midterm and final are in class essays and he is concise, and prepares students well with exactly what to expect. Great class!"
very helpful professor.Its up to the student to pass.I received an A.text book is a must
"One of the best professors in the department. His course is organized, which helps you grasp the big picture at the end. He\'s also a funny guy."
"I dropped her class after the first day. She has a terrible personality, and she seems very cold toward her students. She doesn\'t use blackboard at all and expects students to keep track of their own grades, which is ridiculous b/c that should her job as the teacher. It\'s like she\'s setting you up for failure from the start. DO NOT TAKE HER!"
great professor. Really tries to make it interesting. fun labs and she\'s just an overall fair and nice person. Highly recommend her!
"Carelli is very nice and tries to keep her lectures interesting but doesn\'t always succeed. MC exams, no trick questions. Extra credit offered on second exam. You do need all 3 books because there are short stories from the extra 2 that are on the exams. As long as you go to lecture and/or read the textbooks, the class is an easy A."
"He is very hard, do all the work, show up, and listen. he gives many chances, but you must take advantage of them.YOU WRITE LIKE NO OTHER,BUT OVERALL HE IS A GREAT TEACHER JUST DON\'T PUSH HIS BUTTONS OR GET ON HIS BAD SIDE"
Amazing professor. His IS330 class is awesome. Very understanding if you forgot to hand in your assignment on time. Would recommend for anyone
"Wow, what a wonderful teacher. His very passionate about teaching."
"She is an incredible teacher. I really enjoyed her classes, they were very informative, and that\'s really saying something when the material is so dense!"
"AMAZING PROF. Made me chose a physics major. So approachable, always available for extra help. Exams and midterms are VERY fair, chooses three easy questions and one challenge question which was from the assigned problems (which most people neglect). LOVE U PETER"
He\'s so awesome!! He makes class so much fun. Def. the best at Champlain!!:)
"extremely beautiful and attractive......great professor very caring and thoughtful, passion for the material conveys to the students, clear about exams and tells you wat to study, lost of in class review and usually 1 project per semester and 2 exams"
"The class is easy as you do the work on time. It\' s a lot of work but mostly research on the internet, and you hardly have to use the book maybe just for test."
very caring professor. even cancelled the second midterm because she thought we were stressing so much. everyone loves her. you will be missing out if you don\'t take her class
It was really hard and would not recommend her because she is very hard to follow and complains a lot about her students she makes you feel like your a burden
"The best teacher I have had at Columbia. Yes, you have to work hard, but that only comes with more knowledge. If you put effort and work hard, you will be fine. Being pushed is good thing if you want to be a photographer/artist. Highly recommended!"
there are 4 different versions of the test & quizzes. there not too hard.make sure you do the homework questions so it can help you learn the material better.you end up taking so many notes during class. there are 4 test. the lowest grade is dropped. so 3 test which are worth 65% of you your grade.if you put in the time to study you should be fine.
"Yes, she\'s an easy professor but I really learned nothing in any of her classes. I would have much rather had a professor that taught a lot more about stuff we would need to know how to do. Maybe it was just me but I didn\'t feel I gained anything out of her class."
"Professor Lee was my favorite! She was relaxed, and she knew how to read students and their attitudes. I took this as an 8-week course, and it was very manageable. Her final project was so interesting, and I met a lot of really great people doing it! She did have daily pop quizzes which were based on the reading, but they\'re not difficult."
"Enjoyed her class, she tried hard to make the class relevant and tried to get everone invoved. Project wasn\'t to bad. Study for quizs and tests; not walks in the park. Stick to concepts."
"I am Alumni, class of 1999...Dr. Dominick is absolutely wonderful!"
"Definitely my favorite class first semester! Darren is very funny and makes learning Fortran exciting and interesting. Even for computer novices, he made everything manageable. There are short quizzes at the beginning of the semester but they are not bad if you put in the work. Don\'t be afraid to ask Darren and the upperclassmen questions!"
"Very nice person...her philosophy class is too abstract for students to understand, though. She doen\'t know how to break down the info for students to grasp. The most difficult class of my college career."
"The class is really easy ! You just have to read a bunch of boys he assigns, write down your response to his questions in D2L and talk during discussion. He also make you do a lot of group work. Other than that he is very chill and easy going guy. We even watched some movies to understand our books a little bit more. Attendence is important."
At first I didn\'t really like her but she\'s started to grow on me. Very pro-Liberal but as a Conservative I don\'t think she stretches the truth and it\'s interesting to hear her side of the argument. Allowed the class to eliminate their midterm if they did badly. Essay is very long and this is certainly a graduate like class.
Great guy!! Always with the big smiles! The exams are the assignments almost exactly... what more can you ask for?
"I don\'t understand why Wurmser has such a low rating. His lectures are clear and he even asks if anyone has questions in case his first couple explanations weren\'t clear enough. He\'s extremely approachable and understands students\' needs. Best professor out of the three, his midterm was by far the easiest if you just study the sample midterm."
Fairly interesting and easy class to take. She is funny and tries to keep class interesting. All tests were multiple choice with a few papers throughout the semester. I would definitely recommend her as a professor.
Very organized and nice. You have to be diligent to pass his class but he is more than willing to help. Offers lots of chances for EC.
"Connait bien sa mati\xc3\xa8re, cours assez difficile, beaucoup de lectures et de quiz. Exp\xc3\xa9rience positive dans l\'ensemble."
Class was a lot of fun. I actually enjoyed going and I don\'t really like english classes usually. I would take a class from him again
Im not that great at math and he made this a good year in math for me. As long as you show up and do well on quizzes you will have no problems. Great Professor
"Doug\'s an awesome teacher! Really easy going, approachable, and understanding. One thing that sucked...was even if he finished his lesson, he\'d try to make it drag on to kill more time. But he\'s still awesome, I have nothing bad to say about the guy. His feedback is very helpful aswell. And theres NO FINAL (major plus)! Take him for sure!"
Professor Courtney is a great english professor. She truly cares about all of her students. She assigned 6 essays for this course. She is a very fair grader and wants to see her students achieve. HIGHLY recommend!
"Ruben is a talented artist and a wonderful, patient teacher. I would recommend him to anyone for figure drawing or illustration.. highest recommendation!!!"
Does not know how to teach....not everybody has a phd and knows all the things she does.....makes u feel stupid if u ask a question.......I am here to learn not to self teach myself abouT neuroscience
"Clearly defined, reasonable expectations. Constructive feedback. She made class as fun and as stress-free as possible but it\'s really up to the STUDENTS - my group had a great time. Very helpful. Reasonable homework. No subs. Eye contact issue may be cultural. Expected to hate this class but actually enjoyed it. I recommend Ms. Senoo highly."
Films were interesting. She really tries to get everyone to participate. Easy grader if you do the work.
"Good course, good prof, requires work but definitely a possible A"
Cindy is great! i have her for 300 and she makes the class a lot of fun. topics can be difficult but she takes her time to make sure you understand the material. very happy i got her!
"I absolutely loved Dr. Gehring and his genuine care for each and every student. The interesting material covered in lecture was underscored by his passion for the subject. Exams are fair if you pay attention in lecture and review the study guide. I highly recommend 240 but take any class you can with Dr. Gehring, you won\'t regret it."
"Extra credit will be your best friend if bio is not your strongest subject. There are 4 exams (mc and essay), online hw, 2 notebook assignments, & 1 field trip assignment. You really have to put in the work and effort if you want to pass. Bio is tough but the professor is really helpful and funny! You can tell she wants all her students to pass."
"You can literally teach yourself the material off the powerpoints she posts, you won\'t miss anything because she just says the same thing regurgitated and talks herself in circles. I slept in class and it was a 1:10 because she was just droning on and on."
I loved this class. To anyone who has left a bad review it is simply b/c they did not try. This professor wants to see her students excel & become better rights & individuals. She gives you so much freedom to write about topics that matter to you. If you need to learn how to be more outgoing & write essays longer than 4 pages. This is a great class
Too bad he is always late explanations are incomprehensible projects are terrible not clear final contents
"Professor Densley is the best. He is a seasoned actor and performer but also a fantastic teacher of that art. He is honest and super insightful. Totally non judgmental, and hilarious at times. Fun and understanding. He specializes in movement classes and it is so stinking cool."
"She is a good teacher, but she never comes to class. She does not hardly ever use a textbook and likes for you to write a lot of papers. She left over halfway through the semster. She will set up meetings with you and then not show up. I would not recommend this teacher to anyone."
great political science teacher ever. definitely take him.
"Gave good study techniques.Always responded to email questions quickly. Very helpful. This was online, so I can\'t tell you if she is hot or not."
"very easy class, barely came to class and wrote bs on essay and i blank out on final but i ended up with a C. so it\'s not that bad :-)"
"(Observation & Assessment) Professor Cine was a bit confusing at the beginning of the semester but she came around. She is very clear on what she wants. The tests are okay, pay attention in class, show up and complete all of your assignments and you\'ll PASS !!!"
"He is the craziest teacher I have ever had, and loves to say things for the shock value. He\'s interesting, but a very tough grader. The quizzes were extremely difficult, but he takes pity and usually curves them. He tends to rant during class about what he dislikes about the texts, but is interesting. You do a lot of reading for this class!"
"GREAT class. I loved the material, but going into it I really had no idea what to expect. There is A LOT of material but she is a fantastic professor, both in the online lectures and in person. The structure of the class is strange at first but I grew to like it. Brilliant woman! One of the harder psych courses. MUST watch pre-recorded lectures"
Extremely knowledgeable and clear.
Excellent teacher. You\'ll walk away from his class wanting to be a better person. My advice is open your mind and express yourself in your writing and you\'ll do well.
"He is a awful teacher. He ca not explain what he means, and he doesn\'t make his exam directions clear. He doesn\'t do a very good job at explaining things and you will get confused very very easily. I do not recommend him as a teacher, especially if you struggle with math."
Great teacher for SSD. Classes are in a discussion style which makes it easier to learn and participate. Very down to earth. Very real. Book not needed. You\'ll definitely have fun in this class. :)
Easy and interesting class. I highly recommend it!
Jay is so cool! He\'s the best professor at this school. If you have trouble with anything he is always willing to help. Really great teacher.
great guy. Always helpfull
"I have made way more progress in composition than I expected. She really cares about the students, and always has helpful ideas about our pieces during the office hours."
Great professor. Very helpful with the material. Great metaphors. Tough grader but worth it.
Horrible experience with Dr. Clark. He grades you on only a few assignments and gives you no feedback for any of them. You have no idea what your grade is until the end of the course. Thinks he knows everything and likes to flex his academic muscles against a bunch of students just trying to learn. AVOID HIM.
Mr. Given is a cool guy but overall he is just a square. He threatened to kick me out of his class for talking. Someone needs to have fun during his boring commentary!! He doesnt even teach but he his class is an easy A!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"I really loved Rzepka. I took Romanticism with him as a sophomore and I felt really nervous after hearing he really knows his stuff, but I am so glad i took his class! His lectures were always well prepared, engaging, and thoughtful, and really helped us engage with the text. He\'s also quick to put some pop culture references in. Recommend!!!"
Lectures are really interesting. Great teacher who really knows what hes talking about. Gives allot of second chances if you didn\'t do the assignment right the first time.
"She presented the information thoroughly and she\'s a great person. Heck, I took her at Miami and still think about her even though she\'s at Cal State. Miami misses your greatness and unparalleled beauty."
sooo easy--she is really nice and helpful--hardly any work in this class but u still learn--if u want an easy a class this is it
David was very helpful and completely interested in helping his students become good writers. I recieved an A in this writing course and I hate to write. That should tell you something.
Fascinating and made learning Russian a treat.
"Absolutely awful. He believes his English is flawless. He will mark your essays with comments such as ""can\'t see it"" ""use non-technical terms."" He adores ; and :, he forces students to use them, even if multiple sentences makes more sense. You will learn nothing from taking this class, except for conspiracy theories and his political ideology,"
She is the tip top! You will learn organic chemistry. Be aware that the class is incredibly time consuming being one of the more difficult classes offered at the 2000 level. Dr. Cuevas is incredibly helpful and insightful as she teaches the art of organic chemistry. The book is awesome too!
"Loved this class, loved this professor! It was an 8 week course. Each week you learn about a different continent and their music. As long as you do the discussion boards, study guides, listening journals, and tests, you will have a solid easy A. It may seem a lot at first, but its easy and straight forward work."
"Very knowledgable. Gives study guides for tests no surprises overall. HOWEVER, I do not believe she should be teaching freshmen LC\'s.Hs to college is a big change and her LC does not make it easy to adjust. Shes a great professor to take as a separate course in my opinion. The LC is set up for disaster, always complaints in grading and experience."
"US Literature to 1865 with Raabe is an enjoyable course, but you have to be willing to do the work. Lots of assignments and reading, but tests are not weighted as much as in most English courses. We wrote 2 papers, took 2 exams, and had lots of mini-assignments. An A grade is possible if you are willing to work hard! Take notes for test essays!"
Great teacher!! Very easy to summit everything online! He is easy going and very helpful!!
i took him for finite math. He is extremely hard to follow. he doesnt care if you skip class. he wants you to read the MATH textbook. you basically have to teach yourself but its a pretty easy A
All you have to do is go to class and do the essays. there is no way of failing her class. your grade determines the average of your papers.
"If taking him for an advanced spanish class then he\'s probably good, but if you\'re taking him for Spanish 1-4 avoid. He decided to completely gid rid of the book and online lab which I thought would be good but he replaced it with no structure. the tests have no indication of any tense to use. He basically talks at us in class and we never speak"
Excellent....very helpful...highly recommend...
Worst teacher ever! ive never hated a teacher in my life until now. Take any other math teacher but her. Unless you want to be disappointed with your grade.
this teacher is cool..... he\'s a ladies man
"Intro Bio is a team taught course and I thought Dr. Hale\'s section was the hardest because it seemed like she purposely did not tell her students what was on the test and I felt mislead. However, if you work hard, relisten to lectures, read the textbook, and go to office hours or tutoring an A is possible."
Take his advice on study habits at the beginning of term and you will do well. Has funny anecdotal stories and really helps you understand the sequence of events in history. I could listen to him talk about history all day.
"This man makes no sense whatsoever. He may be a good physical ed teacher, but he should not teach in the classroom. He just makes no sense, and you never know what he\'s talking about to begin with. I would not recommend him for any class."
"Dr. Williams was a good professor. I had to take her, not knowing a thing about the class, and it turned out to be quite interesting and managable. Unless you\'re a computer worm already, you may need to take this class seriously cuz I didn\'t, and that\'s why I didn\'t do as well, but she went out on a limb to help me. Tough class, interesting."
"Understanding, nice teacher, fair grader, classes were always interesting and never boring"
"She\'s a very nice teacher, it was her 1st time teaching business chinese, so it\'s alittle unorganized. Ya I dont see how I dont give her 5 on clarity...she made us repeat each paragraph like 4 times @ least. Everything\'s crystal clear."
"She has good intentions, but has little appreciation for what students are doing for projects. Groups frequently told that it wont work, think of something else. Also, is not very clear on what is wanted on assignments."
Terrible! I am an A student and I worked my butt off to get this B. His lectures are long and you learn nothing. When you ask him a question he makes you feel dumb and tells you to look in the book. He is literally the worst professor I have ever seen and I have had some bad professors. DO NOT TAKE HIM. 20+hours of studying weekly easy.
"I took this class online. Sreerama encouraged us to ask questions and be open minded. Being a mom and three kids I could not keep-up and fell behind. He not only understood my difficulties, went beyond my expectations and was very flexible in deadlines to complete the course. Keep in mind you still need to work hard to earn the grade."
"Good lectures, interesting class. There was a lot of homework and the instructor did his best to grade. He accepted late assignments and would wait to collect all of the same assignments before grading. He posted our progress / grades weekly which was nice."
"Cant imagine not having SGM at TU, wouldn\'t be able to make it through without her. Great advisor, teacher, and person. Take everything she offers!"
Kelly was great. She worked with every student and made sure everyone understood everything.
"A very intelligent man. He definitely knows his stuff and will really make you think. Class participation is not required, but he loves it when you do. Don\'t expect him to EVER know your name, though. His tests are easy, as long as you read. He lets you go early and doesn\'t take attendance all the time. Take him; you\'ll learn A LOT."
I had Mrs. Hopkins for 3 classes in the las 2 years and she is amazing. I could ask any question and she helped. Not only that but she is the first person in my whole life that has made me understand math.
"Wonderful teacher. Very thorough, well prepared, friendly, and won\'t hold you for three hours to teach you one hour of material."
"She is definitely friendly and enthusiastic. That being said, however, I cannot stand to listen to her teach. She stumbles over her words a lot and is very scattered. Most of the questions students have during class she has to look up the answer to. I almost feel as if I could have taught the class."
Awesome guy and very helpful during office hours.
I showed up the first day for the late start class and got an add slip. I added her class the next day. Before the class started on the next meeting day I asked if I can be excused later on in class to attend a tele-confrence with a university and she said I would lose 10 points and that I need to be in class for the entire time. dropped same day
Xidos is a great guy and super funny but is an incredibly confusing professor. He over complicates nearly all concepts and teaches you more than you need to learn. You would think that would be an advantage but it truly is not. Spends countless lectures going over meaningless information and skims through important stuff. Take with smirnova!!!
"She is tough and can be scary, but she is a great teacher. She is my advisor as well, and really goes out of her way for people. She is strict and tough, but the way she teaches makes you learn and think about things."
Very easy class. If you don\'t walk out of this class with an A or a B then it is your fault. Very nice guy. Take home mid-term and mock trials for a final. Very flexible and wants students to learn but have fun as well.
Worst prof ever. She is so completly random and scatterbrained. She has no idea what she\'s talking about and I\'m pretty sure she was dropped as a baby.
"Danae regurgitates information she had memorized from her vast years of useless education. However, she just uses simple apelike teaching of looking at patterns and not really interested in absorbing anything. One can see she is not teaching to help the betterment of a student or society. If you want a babysitter, she is the teacher for you."
Very unorganized with her record keeping. Students get a lower grade than they deserve because of her bad record keeping! Very hypocritical since she preaches organization. She should stick to counsling an stay away from teaching
Dutt did a great job teaching her first semester. She provides her students with ample opportunities of practice as well as extra credit. The class itself requires a decent amount of work out of class but she really cares about her students
"He has a great personality. BUT His class is SO BORING you\'ll be asking for a huge meteor to hit earth so class could be canceled or let out early. His tests are the hardest thing you\'ll ever take! The ""study guide"" YOU have to make is 15 pages or more! Get ready to study like you never have before if you want a decent grade!"
RUN!!!!!!
prof. lichtman was great. it\'s the only class i have been to every single session of. he always kept things interesting and i loved the take-home everything. i could have done without the accents though.
I LOVE HIM!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Ms. Baker is a super sweet lady and great teacher. She really cares and wants everyone to do well in her class. She makes public speaking easy and the class fun. She provides positive feedback that helps students improve. If you don\'t get an A in her class, it\'s because you aren\'t trying or aren\'t coming to class! Highly recommend her!!"
"She only uses the book and does not really go over anything in class that is relevant, she also uses large incomprehensible words, when asked to ""dumb down"" her vocabulary nothing changed.... she was asked by the whole class of at least 30....dont take her unless you like to read a lot!"
"Going to class & doing the homework is essential to learning the material - take advantage of the SI session if you need extra help (andor extra credit). Bonus question(s) on all THREE tests - usually an extra +5 points. Willing to answer questions in class; sometimes gives confusing answers, just ask for more clarification."
Loves to teach the old fashioned way. Lecture is about 95% of the class. You will be bored but the material sinks in if you listen.
Wow it\'s like the last posters werent even in the same class I experienced. Sounds like they didn\'t get grades they wanted. Tinic was fantastic. This is my second class with her and I\'ve registered for another next year. The class was dynamic and engaging. Tinic is also always available for in depth discussions outside of class. Make the effort!
Susan was a super fun prof. I looked forward to her class every week. Don\'t skip class as she has fill in the blank notes (and gives helpful hints for difficult topics). You can tell she really loves chemistry and wants everyone to like it as much as she does. She\'s super sweet and is always ready to help/answer questions.
She is great. Very helpful and such an amazing person. She genuinely loves what she teaches and enjoys simply having conversations in class about the topic.
"Fun Zombie Apocalypse class :) Prof is easy to get along with, he\'s open to comments and talks without being too lecture heavy. Also if you miss something, for a valid reason not out of laziness, he\'s cool at giving another option so you can try for marks. I would recommend him for sure."
"Probably the best professor I had in undergrad. Extremely helpful, accomodating, and friendly. Fair marker. Very intelligent. Excellent class discussions."
"i LOVE her! A sweet old women who means well. I took it as a night class- NEVER stayed later than 7:30! a 30 question mult. choice midterm (AND CURVED- super easy!!) group project- simple, and a take home final. Great lady, highly recommended"
"good teacher, takes his time teaching. more than willing to help you out. tells lots of stories which is cool if you like that stuff. really good guy too"
the worst teacher i have ever had go to another school for heavy eaquipment operator if he is going to be your teacher . i got 90% on test and he still gave me Cs in every class. if he doesnt like you as a person he will give you bad grades. i hate this teach . he has no morals and does not care about your furture take students to the dean .
"She was very unclear and she often forgets what she assigns. She doesn\'t give partial credit either, which is NO good!"
I liked this class. She had a sense of humor (but I had to push to see it!)
"Tori changed my life! She showed me a completely new way to see the world. She created a drive to learn Sociology. It\'s true that she isn\'t an easy grader but to get above a B in her class is a BIG deal because of this and you should feel proud of yourself. If you can make it with Tori, you can make it anywhere."
"Funny woman, great stories. Fairly easy grader"
"He was extremely hard to follow, especially compared to Morgan, who, although full of himself, actually could articulate the material. Thacker basically read various exerpts from the text and usually got the page numbers wrong so you couldnt find it if you wanted to. Horrible prof."
"Way good teacher! This guy really understands how to teach a class. At first you might wonder what you got yourself into, but once you get to know him, he is way good. Knows his stuff, has real world experience, and is a great teacher on top of it all."
"She makes the class fun, has a great sense of humor, and generally does a good job of preparing students for exams."
"She\'s an amazing teacher. Focuses class off of book about philosopher/writers. be ready to do essays as well as ongoing presentation one must do sometime throughout course assigned day one. a lot of critical thinking. if you love analyzing and diving into these writers\' work, you\'ll love this class. Always gives great feedback. Always there to help"
"Don\'t do it. He doesn\'t teach, just clicks through and makes frequent errors. One of the students has to coach him through. He doesn\'t want to be here, neither do you. He just sets up assignments and you go thru the book yourself. There is no instruction. If you want to learn, take Ravanshad instead."
"THE MOST TIME-CONSUMING CLASS YOU WILL EVER TAKE! Too bad it\'s mandatory for business majors. Toaddy is a nice guy, but he doesn\'t really ""teach."" You do CLA\'s every day, and the book work can take forever. The book is your teacher for this class. Overall, an easy, yet time-consuming and sometimes frustrating, class."
"She is not only Hot but she is great. One of the best teacher and she knows her materials. Thanks Reggie. She was so good that by the end of the course,2 peoples changes their major to Accounting. I am one of those convert. We will miss you Reggie...and she is hot"
"One of the most fun prof\'s ever, extremely into the material and cared about the students doing well even though it was a large first year class. Was proud to be in his last class ever taught at Lakehead"
Mike Who? Seriously...terrible course. Want my money back.
"She brings her personal issues to class and picks favorites. If you are one of her favorites, good for you. If not, no matter what you do, she won\'t appreciate it. She doesn\'t appreciate hard work. I came to every single class and did all the assignments and it still wasn\'t good enough. She is not recommended."
"Prof was late every class. Mostly uses examples to explain concepts, HW is not mandatory but helps. Most students found it easier to try and self teach. Went to his office for help and left more confused than I went in - offered no further explanation or assistance in understanding concept. Not a bad prof, but would not recommend."
"Survey of Calculus Modular. He\'s a very quiet, kind person. I do alright with math so it wasn\'t a big strain on me. Some people don\'t like math and didn\'t enjoy his shyness. He is however very understanding, kind, and helpful if you need anything at all from him. Super nice."
Mike is awesome! He makes lectures interesting even though the material can be extremely dry. He gives clear instructions on how you\'ll be tested and what his expectations are. Make sure to study lots for this course because it is loaded with information.
"Mr. Guzowski is an excellent teacher, all you have to do is show up, put in the work, make an effort, and stay for the entire class. His requirements for this semester were to write several essays, two papers, and participant in class discussions."
"If you\'re not a math person do not take Napier. He\'s very quick and doesn\'t explain very throughly, he doesn\'t give any other grades besides tests, so if you fail one test it\'s almost impossible to pull the grade back up. Oh and he doesn\'t respond to emails."
"Smart, cool, fun."
"I had to teach myself everything, he moves through the textbook faster than I can understand. He also talks very low even though he has a microphone and is very hard to heard and very hard to understand. Only use going to class is clicker points, but if you don\'t get those right then why go? I was so far behind and so confused I didn\'t even go."
I would have to agree with the previous comment.
She was a wonderful teacher! She is very helpful and willing to explain it until you get it. Just be ready to speak in front of the class a lot and write your examples on the board so she can use them as examples to the rest of the class. It got embarrassing sometimes but I learned a lot from it! I would definitely take her again.
"Best math teacher ever, i really hope i get to have him for math 010B this spring semester"
Pretty clear cut HW and tests. Definitely recommend! Never used book. pretty straightforward class.
"I have mixed feelings about Gary Bolding. He gives good feedback but he is very judgmental and full of himself, and he picks favorites. You are better off not showing your talent right away because he will expect the world out of you and if you disappoint him once you have fallen from grace. He is better than Matt Roberts or Gunderson though."
Great teacher!!! makes class interesting and good sense of humor. Loved his class Highly recommended. He also teaches math. Best teach I have had so far.
"Excellent teacher. He loves what he does. Doesn\'t really follow book, though."
Take any course you can from this teacher. The best of any instructor I have every had.
She is awesome
"He is now an online professor for Brenau University, but as others mentioned his assignments or homework is still thought-provoking. I always say he teaches above the level of what the student is meant to learn (i.e. if you are an undergrad you are taught graduate level concepts). I really have a love hate relationship for him."
This was such an easy class. I took it for Summer I and it was a breeze. Concepts aren\'t difficult & Quizlet has your back on this course. Very easy A. Group project wasn\'t bad.
"This teacher, is very excited about what she teaches, and is very freindly. She is a very good teaher, comfortable to be around and her course was easy. I recomend taking a class with her."
"Seeing that I am an english major, I enjoy all English. I do enjoy Dr. Nutter\'s class though. He is a good teacher. I would suggest him to other students. I would seriously consider taking him for other classes also."
"Easy B, extremely hard A. Gino is amazing. You will enjoy and learn a lot. However, take his Quiz seriously. DO NOT SLACK OFF. 43% of your grade comes from group project. Everyone shares same score in your group. Good Luck! If you want to learn (COM major), take him definitely! If you are looking for easy A elective, this is NOT the class, AVOID!"
"Talks in Spanish whole class (no expections). If you don\'t already know Spanish going in, it can be tough. Calls on students and makes you answer even if you truely do not know the answer. Test are pretty straight forward off of study guide. Online homework due every class and the access code is expensive (over $100)."
"Confusing, yep that\'s the word. He is very, very confusing in teaching. You take his classes and get ready to pull your hair out. I hated the fact that every story he told us he made himself part of it. Good luck."
"I can\'t imagine not thinking that Dennis is the coolest teacher out there. He is smart, funny, nice, and helpful. What more could you want in a teacher? Classes with Dennis are engaging, and make you create art you weren\'t even aware was in you. Take his classes!"
"Material cut and dry, no nonsense type of teaching. Very unsociable, tests are difficult, ruthlessly grades homework assignments. Seems like kind of a loner, almost feel bad for the guy. Seems like he cares and is otherwise nice, I guess."
This class was not bad but I do feel like she does not really go over the material well enough. I do not think she planned well for her lectures and I also think that most students did not do well on her tests and the wording was really difficult. She is an amazing lady and really into her subject!
"Great professor. She gives you all the notes you need and you only have to do two easy courtroom write ups and one brief final from the notes and the internet. Plus, she\'s a FOX!!!!"
"He only gives to essay papers to write an they ar your exams. I found his class to be very easy and I didn\'t even read the book, I just took notes on his lecture and he also emails you his notes."
This lady does not give two flying [bleeps] about the students. You go to her for help and shes says theres nothing I can do. Shes not a teacher but the coordinator..and what a poor one she is. No wonder why the teachers sucked. smh
Great teacher!
"Prof. Blecker is one of the most if not the most influential professor I have ever had. His class is useful, insightful & it forces you to think. I am a better student b/c of him. In addition, the material he uses for class is more appropriate for those who are planning to take the NY bar. Higly recommend taking him."
"I don\'t disagree with people in saying she is a nice lady. However, all she does is recite from the book which is already outdated. Also the fact that the grade is mostly based on participation slows the class down dramatically because people talk for the sake of just talking. Overall not the best teacher."
"Unsuitable in the classroom, unsafe in clinical! Absolutely wretched!!!"
She was very nice. The class was not too difficult but I never had enough time to Study. We covered 1.5 chapter per day and had homework and work sheets due the following day. overall she is a nice easygoing teacher. Helpful and fun as well plus good sense of humor..
Professor Jitin teaches very well and he is well organized and presents lecture in understandable way and pushes student participate and discuss questions. if you pay attention and PARTICIPATE and TURN IN PROJECTS ON TIME you will be fine. don\'t listen students ranting here and blaming on the professor while they ain\'t put in the work.
He\'s the man!
Love
Pittman is interesting. He tends to deviate into the notes and hypotheticals so do not get lost! And all those little deviations will be on his test.
He can explain the hardest concepts with the greatness that everyone will get it
"Concert band- Amazing music selection, conducting and personality. Definitely one of my favorite professors at URI. Don\'t miss rehearsals- they are too much fun."
"Important course to take. One of the best Professors I\'ve had at the College. She is knowledgeable and stresses the importantance of alot of things. She is a fair grader, but do study as this is a First Aid course. Means between life or death. Take it."
"This class was great. There wasn\'t anything hard to do. We had a group project really easy, a few online homework assignments, 3 test one online the other in class, and of course the final. There is also an oral exam which is easy as well, because she gives you the topics to study. I love the professor. You\'ll definitely learn, and have fun."
"Best Discrete Math professor you can ask for. I showed up everyday and paid attention and got an A in the class. She will explain everything, gives tons of examples, will answer your questions and will try to never leave you confused. Probably the best professor I\'ve had so far in this school."
He and the text are both interesting. He lets you use any edition to save money. This man loves both the students and the subject matter. Got a B+ this term by following the review sheets.
"Strachan is a great professor. He makes law interesting, which is really difficult. He\'s hilarious and his lectures are straight to the point. Tests and quizzes are challenging because they are mostly T/F questions. If you study and read the questions carefully you can definitely get an A."
"Great teacher, explains things well if you ask her to. Not the most enthusiastic teacher but her dry humor is funny a lot of the time. A great teacher overall."
"Professor Martin is great! For such a boring and dreaded class, she made it completely tolerable! She used fun examples and you could tell that she actually cares about the class that she\'s teaching. She\'s also an extremely nice and caring person outside of class if you ever need help with assignments or your grades in general. Take her class! :)"
"Lectures in monotone, puts you to sleep. Very few people showed up to his lectures. When I went to office hours he wasn\'t very helpful, one question I asked him the answer was basically ""If you\'d been in lecture you would know."" Put stuff on the exams that he hadn\'t covered in class. He did give me a few points regrade though."
made me write a paper on my birthday...dammit
"I enjoyed going to class, but she moves pretty fast."
Wonderful! A sweetheart . . .
"He is the sweetest professor I have taken! Super kind and helpful, in addition to being a lenient grader. His class was quite relaxed and enjoyable. Pay attention to his lectures and you are solid; his lectures are key to studying for his quizzes and tests. It\'s been a good semester with him."
"This is a pretty easy class. A lot of paper writing but she lets you do papers over if you don\'t like your grade. She also reviews well for the midterm and such. She is a good teacher, but doesn\'t explain things very well."
"this professor is very hard, to me he didn\'t help at all he is for who he wants. he teaches so fast he doesn\'t give you time to catch up at all. he sucks!!!!!!!"
"If taking notes is your pet peeve, Dr. Shim is the perfect professor. He\'ll take the notes for you and then post them on blackboard for you. Involves quite a workload, but it doesn\'t take much time. Just make sure you do it all, and i guarantee at least a B."
"Hamid is good, not great. He\'s friendly and gives good lectures, but his exams are very hard."
Professor kaur is amazing. She is teaching a difficult course so naturally people will not find it easy but she makes it relatively easy. She is so helpful nice and sweet. Pick her for orgo.
"One of my favorite teachers I\'ve had thus far at Memphis. She treats her students like adults and she doesn\'t grade hard. I do agree some group things she had us do was pointless but for the most part, I recommend her."
She was by far the worst proffesor I have ever had. She did not respond to some of my emails and when she did her response did not address my questions often. She posted notes about to help with some of the sentences we had and I followed exactly what it said to do and was marked down for it. Her due dates changed with little notice. Got 3.9
Makes class very un boring. Tells a lot of corny jokes but they do come across funny at times. Never angry and always making kids get out of there comfort zone when meeting new people. a lot of group work but an easy A or B if you get the work done. Overall awesome guy would 100% recommend.
it is very bad professor.
SO ******* HOT!!!! Good teacher and not a hard grader. VERY HOT!
"His lectures are worthless, he doesnt test you on them at all. He is a horrible teacher, do not take him."
Ms. O is an awesome teacher. She is extremely talented and helpful. She made the class fun with games and educational. I\'ve learned a lot in this class. I passed the class with an A and passes Eng84 exit exam. I get to skip Eng84 and go to Eng1A. That\'s cool!
"He was extremely helpful whenever anyone had a question. Even though the work load is a lot, as long as you stay on top of your assignments, you will not fail this class. Just paying attention helped...he basically told you exactly what was on each quiz or exam. Highly recommend!!!"
"Wow! After complaining to him several times during office hours about how my grade was unjustified, he actually told me ""dont worry, i wont you screw u when it comes to your final grade"". He then screwed me on my final grade...Thanks again!"
Worst professor ever!!! Do not take her class. I would take this class at another college before taking her class. Very tough grader and she is very disorganized and very unclear with instructions. Beware of this one.
"This teacher is very good. He\'s always \'chill\'. The prof is very good, he\'s a good researcher, he has written some book, the Jorion\'s book (we use it in class) is absolutely bright! 10 short quizes, + Final exam. You have to study all time, but the cours is excellent. Recommendation: 100%"
"I think this prof is great, she is a little add, but is great at explaining things, and she makes things fun to learn. I think if you pay attention and do the work you should have no problem getting an A."
"Not exactly clear with the instructions, but overall a good teacher and class. Probably better in real life than online. Make sure to write a LOT for the writing assignments and discussion boards online. He kept telling me my answers were good, but not long enough. Be prepared to write and actually do the work."
Could this possibly be the worst professor at PBCC? My goodness what a sorry excuse for an educator. This woman has no idea what she is doing. Using slides with minimal examples is not the way to teach chemistry. Do not under any circumstance take this woman. You\'re better off waiting until Chow is available or take it at FAU.
"Mrs.Muniz is a great teacher. She is willing to help you understand math. A very fair grader, who else would give partial credit on tests. A+ teacher!"
"Nancy is an awesome professor. She is always dressed sharp, has great attitudes, bubbly. Great lady..."
He\'s the best professor in FAU
"She is a very positive and upbeat person, and passionate & knowledgeable about this info. I learned a lot in this class and was glad I took it with her. Tests do require studying but the challenge is well worth it."
Best Prof I have had at OU. He is super supportive and really makes it easy for you to pass the class if you actually try.
"Okay, this class is not that hard. You have to do all the studying on your own. I have never had a teacher read word for word from a text book as she did. Its hard to stay awake in the class, but if you read the chapters you can do fine on your own. Total of 4 tests 1 final and 10 quizes are the grades."
"Well, the class was not the best English class I\'ve ever taken. The readings were okay. Andy is a go-with-the-flow guy when it comes to discussions. The discussions in class were often slow and dull at times. Beware, for this class, you have to come up with your own prompts for your two papers. Can be a good thing or a disaster."
Awful at lecturing. I\'ve had teachers with hard-to-understand accents but they understood how slides could help students understand when they can\'t hear clearly. Virdi uses no slides. Won\'t mention the textbook then tests only on the textbook.
"Easy art credit, but in trade for a long grueling, monotonous class period. She Cannot work technology so be prepared for long halts and periods of absolute nothing when she attempts to turn on a television or raise the volume."
"WOW, that\'s all I have to say. He do NOT explain anything. He hands out worksheets without telling us what to do and wants us to figure it out. Go to office hours and get no where.If you get higher than a c- in his class you\'re lucky."
He certainly knows a lot about science but is not a good teachers.In order to pass this class you will have to teach yourself.Take the weekly quizes and make sure you read the chapters. The exams are quite tough...
"This class is SOOOO EASY!!! I\'m taking this class online during the summer, and it\'s not stressful at all! You get to take the test twice and the answers are all online...you\'re guaranteed an A on every test and an A in the course :)"
"Very unclear, extremely poor grammar and typing, no feedback or active participation on discussion forums except for a few off topic comments, and scolded students for being off topic. Didn\'t moderate or attempt to keep the discussion forum unbiased. Selected the wrong text book and didn\'t rectify till after the class started. Horrible, just awful."
This guy is not fooled by the social advantages and tricks from keeners/lawkids that lead them to appropriate all the supposed demonstrations of superiority in law. He is a stand up guy and a great prof. People who take his class will learn and the grade distribution will be more fair than other classes. Not a hypocrite like some at the law school.
"Chamberlin is awesome, I had her for marriage and family, and I learned so much. I made like a 103 in her class. You HAVE to go to class in order to get the notes, because the her tests are all on class notes. Do not bother opening the book. Plus the last two weeks, she gives extra credit almost every class."
Great professor! Beautiful too!
The only good thing was that you got to use huge flashcards on the test and final. Other than that i did not like this class. It is hard to understand her teaching method and yes she does stop the class if someone whispers. Her test are HARD! beware of this teacher
"a very nice teacher that helps her students. She is not hard , gives homework and the tests are not difficult. if you study for every test you are good.Highly recommended!"
"Lab was pretty much worthless this semester, I did well but learned nothing. The only two days I had a valuable lab, were the two days she was gone. She\'s probably a good chemist, but a very poor teacher."
"The first week 42 students, the last week 9 students only! The worst professor every! I don\'t recommend this teacher to anyone. He leaves everything on you as self study! He doesn\'t encourage you to study the book and he asks questions from the book! From the first lecture to the last one, he encourages students to drop the class!"
Good professor
Very helpful. Fast paced but I liked that. She made sure it was very clear.
"Tests are completely different than the homework and topics in class. Be sure to read every single case study in the text book, otherwise the midterm and final will be impossible. Be prepared to be ridiculed in class for questions, and expect a hint of racism. Overall, very unprofessional professor. Follow IRAC form in papers or receive a bad grade"
Awesome professor! He knows his stuff and makes this subject pretty interesting. His lectures are crystal clear and take good notes for his quizzes. They are annoying but pretty easy if u pay attention in class and keep up with his reading. He gives 4 papers in all but a very good grader! I ended up with a B for screwing up a bit on the quizzes. =)
goes to fast in lectures.. better have a laptop..lolz he gets picky on the writing assignments... but umm yeh. i gues his extra credit makes up for it... but in class quizzes..better go to class!!! sometimes its just attendance.. easy 100!! drops the lowest 5 quiz grades.. but you take like 20+ quizzes all semester.. alot of material to cover..:(
Professor Neely has by far been my favorite professor in my college career. She makes students comfortable enough to participate in discussions and makes lectures interesting. Will definitely be on the look out for any more courses she teaches.
"She is a bit monotone, but she isn\'t horrible. She\'s pretty nice, overall, but there is a lecture every class."
"This is not an easy A. You have to work to get your grade. She prepares you for what is to come if you are going to go to a 4 year college. She is very, VERY organized and as long as you follow what she says you will do fine. She gives a lot of easy participation grades.She drops your lowest journal grade too."
"Peeler is a very boring teacher, almost makes you uninterested in the lectures. Grades are 4 critiques, 3 tests and 5 quizzes (drops lowest 1). Critiques are about rules and it sucks because most of the events you have to attend cost. Tests include small unnecessary details, most of which might be in the book so read it before tests. Take notes"
nice. great professor. Very passionate about film
"Instuctor was interesting...lectures fun. Tests had NOTHING to do with his lectures. They were NOT written by him, and the quizzes were full of analogies, with no straight-forward answers. Lots of questions with two answers that could be true...you had to find the ""more true"" answer. This straight A student struggled with the tests!"
great professor really wants you to learn. understands the demands of the cdp program wants you to enjoy the class rather than just spitting back answers.
"Class was very easy since every test was open book, notes, and internet. He gives HW every now and then and assigns reading in the book every so often, but it is not really needed since he goes over everything in class. Only downside is that his class can get a bit boring, but overall it is an easy grade and he is helpful."
"If you like math, take his class. If you\'re interested in finance, good luck."
Beware of this teacher. She is cool but very unorganized and you sit there and it seems like time will never come. She assigns quizzes which are easy. Her approach is good but it is a time waster.
Not approachable. Would never take her again. Learned more from tutoring.
"Very easy going, very helpful. Tests are a breeze, he gives great hand outs/reviews! Three tests and a final paper + presentation. Very funny. Class is almost always discussion based. Take him."
"Matt is a great professor, but I believe this is his last semester at KSU. He talked about things that actually mattered, like how to get jobs and internships. But I didn\'t really get anything out of the class, and I\'m nervous that this will make the higher level research class much harder because he is no longer teaching it. 3 abstracts, 2 tests."
"hardest class ever...nice lady, but we are not medical students for a reason."
"A great teacher, was very helpful. Always willing to lend a hand. Would take another class by her again."
Excellent Professor. Make sure to do all the reading that are required. Keep in touch with TAs too.
"Asking questions during class in a polite manner really helps. I found some problems to be challenging and thought I was right. The professor kindly showed the mistake while building off what I said to show valid meanings. I got an A due to hard work. I started off the class kind of rude, which did not go well at all."
"Mrs.Cooksey is a very nice lady. She does everything from the book, gives extra credit assignments, and responds to emails promptly. I would highly recommend her to anyone who is taking Economics."
"Took class online.No instructor assist.Class work was easy, but you never know how to improve on the next assignment because he never grades until the end. By the end of class, only 50% of the grades were posted only because the online test scores are automatic! He\'s too busy to help online class.DON\'T TAKE HIM!"
"This is by far the worst professor of any kind that I have had in my academic career. The material that he assigns is never on the quizzes that he gives, professor Urbano will put you to sleep the first time he speaks he does not make the material interesting in the slightest and he is not a teacher who inspires students to want to do well. 010."
"A phenomenal teacher. Immediately establishes a relationship of respect, but also shows he is approachable. He cares about the success of each student. He will work more than any other teacher I have had to help. It seems the man never sleeps because he is always available through some medium. Giri?s genuine passion and caring set him apart"
"Horrible. Doesn\'t teach. Just watch ""educational"" movies from the 1980s. Don\'t waste your time."
"This is the EASIEST class I have EVER taken (I ended with 108%). Attendance is key because it\'s 5 points a day. There\'s weekly quizzes, but she tells you where the information is so skimming will get you 100%. 2 tests, SUPER easy. She\'s a little boring and doesn\'t really answer questions, but is fine overall. Also 50 extra credit points offered."
The marterial taught is so nonsenically common sense you want to kill yourself every day but she does her best to make an otherwise boring class as interesting as she can.
"Class was great. Professor opened up the chapters for you to get ahead on your work, which helps if balancing work and other classes. Great teacher. Very clear on what is expected of her students."
"I had an amazing time in Geli\'s class. In my experience the students who didn\'t like him were horrible artists, completely unwilling to put in any effort, or both. I commend Geli for his ability to leave the creativity up to the student and let them make their own choices while guiding them. I couldn\'t ask for anything more from my art teacher."
"Decent professor. Not too bad. He does give out pop quizzes, but they are fairly simple if you understand the material. He lectures with powerpoint but he does try to explain as much as possible. Also, his exams are pretty tough. He\'s the type of prof where he\'ll put a hard problem to see if you truly understand the concepts."
"One of the best professors I had at john jay thus far, he actually engages his students and does whatever he possibly can to give you a good grade. If your taking math 106 or 108 definitely take him you will not be disappointed."
"Really cool dude, great power points, if only you could understand a word that came out of his mouth. Pretty weak teacher, avoid if possible."
"Dr. Gibson has an upbeat personality and wants students to really learn. However, sometimes she expects you to really reach to find material and topics for her class without giving a lot of direction. Be prepared for multiple choice tests where you have to pick the ""most-correct answer""."
"One of the worst teachers I\'ve had at this institution. Spent most of her time talking about things that wasn\'t on the test. Only 3 tests given in the class, and the TAs look for very specific wording and dont give second chances to questions they made confusing. Difficulty is more than need be considering that it\'s an intro class"
This woman is perhaps the most cocky and arrogant professor that I\'ve ever encountered at GU...and that\'s saying something. She will condenscendingly peer over your shoulder and make comments/critiques that are aren\'t even right! Its like she\'s trying to pick a fight! She is overall rude as hell and on a power-high.
"This teacher is very unfriendly, almost rude. I love math, but this teacher made it seem like a chore instead of something to enjoy and excel at. Even though I received a decent grade (since I read quite a bit on my own), I would never take another class from this teacher."
"Professor would make adjustments to online syllabus without telling the class. She would take weeks to reply to emails. Her grading was ambigous and unclear. She allowed students to ramble during discussion which often meant those who needed to present were short on time. I didn\'t really get the point of this class, just a waste of time."
"Dr. Schilling is amazing - I was in an under/over seminar on Forensic Linguistics and we used real data to learn. It was kind of like, here\'s some readings and then a push straight into the data. It was challenging, but she really looks for her students to do their best and get into the data, using real evidence and making analyses. Take her class."
HARD MIDTERM/FINAL. ONE GROUP PROJECT. MANDATORY ATTENDANCE. POWERPOINT IS NOT HELPFUL DURING TESTS. FOCUS ON THE TEXT. HARD GRADER BUT GAVE 28 EC PTS. GOT AN A- GRADES ON CURVE WHEN STUDENTS DO BAD ON MT. STUDYGUIDE NOT VERY HELPFUL. FUNNY TEACHER.
"Incredibly sweet, she urged us to use only Spanish and spoke clearly and slow enough for us to comprehend,unlike other spanish teachers whose first language is spanish, therefore speaking quite rapidly. There were fun activities, and we were always talking with peers."
"You have an individual assignment due every week, along w 2 group presentations throughout the quarter. Attendance is required. She hates it when people are late or do not show up to class. She\'s very strict about her policies. It\'s her way or the highway. She has an attitude problem, so just be on her good side. Lectures are boring. Do not take."
"hes ok, very boring, goes off topic, but i hate that he is so anal about attendance and homework. were not in elementary, were in college."
"Very nice teacher! Her class is pretty easy, tests are a little bit challenging because they are over 6 chapters and she doesn\'t really teach from the book. I was confused on what to study sometimes, but over all she is a great teacher and funny!"
Great class!
"She is very nice. Fun class, easy class."
all i can say is RUN. LIKE. HELL. i\'m serious. i am repeat/forgiving this class in the next semester. Have you ever gotten a 1 out of 100 on a test? no? neither had i until i took this class.
his class is so easy. you dont really need the book at all cuz he doesnt test you on it. the essays you write are actually interesting and he lets you write how you want.
one of the best profs i\'ve ever had. she\'s extremely interested in your opinions and will help you in any way she can.
"Excellent and very intelligent professor. The homework was useful, manageable, and only assigned once a week. Tests were straightforward and graded generously. The subject matter was occasionally convoluted, but that\'s simply the nature of Syntax."
Worst prof I\'ve had at RU. Doesn\'t cater to non geo major students at all. If you\'re taking it to fulfill a requirement avoid her!!
"he is very very boring, and his tests are very detail oriented, this combination can spell disaster"
"Very funny professor. Makes a lot of jokes and skips around alot. He seems to really care about his students and his tests arn\'t to hard, but I do recommend studying. He likes for people to speak up in class, he grades on a curve when neccesary. Work hard and come to class and it will be a enjoyable"
"Very effetive teacher.... will do anything in his power to help students. Also, a sharp wit and attire...."
"I liked her. Class was hard, but she made it enjoyable."
"I LOVE DR. FRAUSTINO!!! SHe helps you if you ask (and sometimes if you dont,which can be annoying. She actually cares), you have to do alot of reading and writing but she graids easy and fairly. I learned alot, and class is fun. Best teacher at this HORRIBLE school. I didnt even want to take the class and I had fun. Really liberal with politics"
"Great professor, keeps the lecture interesting. No surprises , let\'s you know what\'ll be in the tests! Very accommodating. Highly recommend him."
"He kept trying to simplify the readings with examples from football or music, which still flew over my head. The text was heavy stuff, and he would continue to ramble."
"The best professor that I have had yet!!! He engages his audience, loves the material he is teaching, and is a great public speaker."
"Easy enough class, Dr Ames is by far my favorite teacher at Belmont. He\'s approachable, easy to read, easy to communicate with, takes his craft seriously and wants you to succeed. If you respect him and respect the material, then it\'s an easy A."
amazing professor. had him for both years of intro physical anth. loved the field and loved lecturing. tests were changeling but class was very stimulating.
If you just want to skate through English and learn very little then Professor Hayes IS NOT for you! She makes you work and in the process learn to communicate well with English. I have had her for four separate courses and highly recommend her!
She rocks. Definitely recommend.
UNI better wake up. This is the most AMAZING professor we have for this program. She saved our program from going under. I know several students who quit when she was on maternity leave cause they realized how crappy the program was when she wasn\'t there. I hope the administration does something to keep her at UNI or our program is screwed.
"Prof. Adams is a really really awesome teacher! Physics 2 is just a hard subject, but he does a great job of explaining equations and preparing you for tests. Go to class and work old tests to study. If you do the homework and actually can understand examples and equations, you\'ll be fine. Go to his office hours too! He\'s a cool guy"
"Keeps the students interested in what they are learning. Makes the class very enjoyable. The tests are sorta hard, but if you study you\'ll be fine."
"DARBY IS THE BEST, THERE IS NO TEACHER MORE CONNECTED TO HIS STUDENTS"
"Mrs. Cook is awesome, she is fun and if you need help at all she is there!"
"Not helpful, worse teacher, and belittles any questions you ask. The class is SO boring and basically you put together a binder of APA crap!"
"I took this course with her online. She clearly outlines the course and assignment due dates. If you read, do the work, and stay on top of the schedule, you\'ll be fine. She provides test reviews which are helpful. She replies to emails and grades submitted work very promptly! She\'s helpful if you have questions. Great teacher, great class!"
"I took her Hybrid course and she gives ALOT of WORK!!!! if you are not prepared to do ALOT of HW then DON\'T take her, she is no joke!! I wish i would have had someone to tell me what she was really all about b4 i picked her as a professor. She is a good professor and if you need help with something u can ask her but i just think expects to much."
He obviously loves his job and takes the time explain everything to students who may not understand
Simon is a great TA who makes course material very interesting and clear! He is what got me through this course and its too bad we had to switch TAs! (Avoid Salimah if possible). Thanks for everything Simon & we miss you!!!
He is a really nice guy and his class is easy. Be prepared to take a lot of good notes because you can use them on his tests. I would take his class again if it was in my major!!!
"Dr. Beckman is a genius; however, she is not a good teacher, at least not of this class. She is confusing, hard to follow, scatterbrained, and expects students (mostly ling majors) to have a firm grasp on computer code. She also gives an excessive amount of homework. She\'s very nice and energetic, though. Still, I wouldn\'t recommend the class."
"Took this online. Not too difficult class, but the very time-consuming."
"The class is boring. Even with poor attendance, I still managed an A because its an easy class. Homework is basically a completion grade. Exams are reviewed before hand, and everything is graded on a heavy curve. Exams include short essays, but he will tell you line for line what he expects in the review."
great professor
"Her lectures are funny. She is willing to help if you don\'t understand something. For later tests and the final, she gives you a formula sheet because there are so many."
"Class was interesting at times, but Dr. Kazee likes to hear himself speak. There will be some classes where he will talk without asking a single question or involving any students. He gives a lot of pop quizzes and an unreasonable amount reading. Not a lot of grades in the class. Midterm, Final, and two papers. Do not take this class."
"The class is unbelievably boring. He does nothing to grab the student\'s interest. On the other hand, he is a very fair grader."
"Don\'t buy the textbooks!!!! She comes across as a little weird but she\'s nice and teaches well. TA\'s will be a better resource to you than she will be though! Only two papers that are fairly short but you need to have a solid grasp on diagramming. Essay questions for exams are given ahead of time. The material isn\'t hard, just a lot to memorize."
"He is a very cool, fun guy. However, he lectures the entire class, and he often repeats himself. But they are interesting. His tests have nothing to do with his lectures, but they are easy."
"I only liked this class because of the subject which was interesting. He somehow made it really boring. He is a bad teacher, never shows up to class, does not seem like he wants to be there. If he were easy all this would not matter, but he grades pretty hard. I ended up with a B :("
"Dr. Cole is a great professor. He is very knowledgeable in his field. He keeps his class very interesting! You will never fall asleep. If you want to learn about marketing, take this professor. If you want to learn about current trends, take his class."
"Overqualified doesn\'t even begin to describe Mr Yoneoka. His style is very different and takes some getting used to, but its worth it. He remains (2 years later) the greatest prof ive ever had, and I have a hard time believing anyone will ever come close, even in grad school. Epic."
Worst prof ever. Enough said.
"Not bad, but he hardly follows the book at all. He loves to teach things his own way, and you either do everything his way or its wrong. Just keep up with him and you should have no problem. He overdoes it with the technical terms."
the best professor @ FIT...I chose my electives based on what courses she taught.
"What a poser, and SO rude."
"I enjoyed his teaching style-it was different, but I learned more from him than any other psych or soc instructor because it was a self motivating class-you were encouraged to teach yourself about the material and worked!!!He does swear and is honest, but he wants you to be more educated in the topics you are studying. I highly recommend his class"
I really enjoyed Professor Lynch\'s class. She provides you with all the necessary information to do well in the class. Her reading assignments were interesting and not too long. She\'s provides good feedback on papers and responds well to questions. I plan to take her again for ENG1302.
how hot (or not!) she is--isn\'t this for rating instruction? I felt she made difficult material even more confusing and often I felt as though I could understand the material best just reading about it myself. I don\'t recommend her at all.
"You won\'t get a penalty for not going to class, but you do so much in class if you don\'t go, your not passing. Awesome teacher! Helpful and entertaining. One of the best classes i\'ve ever taken."
"I was real into the subject before taking the class. She told us right before the midterm its the hardest class offered at SBCC. No study guides, no recommended tools for doing well. ""Accountable for every word you read, hear, write."" Even if you enjoy the subject offered, I\'d recommend taking something else or just not taking it with her."
"I just read he other students comments and I probably would have said the same things until I did my internship. I was amazed at how of this stuff I needed to know, and my boss was amazed at how much I had learned in Brayley\'s class. Thank you, Dr. Brayley,and I\'m sorry for being so short sighted that I didn\'t appreciate what you did until now."
Took Gerontology as an online winter course. We had daily online posts and one 10 page paper. Tests were fair. Lots of reading. Helpful teacher. Great topics!
"Andrea is phenomenal. She doesn\'t stick to one method and has so many tools for varying actors. She\'s patient and brilliant. She will work your butt off and grades extremely hard, but at the end of the day she broke a lot of my bad acting habits more than any other teacher I\'ve ever had!"
Dont take her!
"VERY one-sided. If you dis-agree with her view on something, she will make you feel dumb for even answering. I answered a question directly from the book and was told it was wrong. She also does not correctly prepare assignments ahead of time. Tests are reasonable but require much thought and are all short answer and fill in the blank."
"He\'s a Dookie - need I say more??? That makes him automatically HOTT and a GENIUS. But seriously, he is extremely smart, and he is every bit as compassionate as well. He loves what he does, and he loves for students to learn, AND...he lives on a farm and drives a truck that runs on vegetable oil -"
"Awful!!!!! Dr Wilson has an extremely high opinion of herself. She has the class sit in a circle and she sits there like the Queen of Sheba, hardly ever speaking!! Avoid at all costs!"
I took an online class. She is not a very emotional person and not very understanding. She makes everything a lot harder than what it needs to be. The thing I can\'t stand the most is her facetious sarcasm. Her energy was not friendly.
"Mark will work with you to make sure that you understand the concept before he moves on. As long as you show up ready to learn and try, you will be good to go."
"Don\'t expect Colin Bailey to go easy on you. Even if you\'ve never taken CLAS before and it\'s an intro course, he will expect you to know everything he\'s talking about. Barely any physical notes, he will stand in front of the class and read a timeline from his own notes and that is what he\'ll do EVERYDAY. No notes, just reading his own notes."
"She is a great teacher. Interesting, helpful and always prepared. Sharp!"
Loads of work in the 2nd half. Assignments are tough. Very strict on papers.
"Hard to understand, but funny at times. Very easy to get an A+"
"Ms. Michele is an excellent instructor. She is very knowledgeable in Political Science. While she is politically a progressive, she tries to stay very neutral in her teaching most of the time. She is a very fair grader. I highly recommend any of her classes."
"The worst. Not helpful, not good at communicating, not good at grading in a timely manner, offers no help whatsoever, and is not at all willing to work with students to help them succeed. Don\'t ever take a class from her!"
"Great instructor, he is very clear although train of though sometimes slips. He is very understanding when it come to assignment completion."
"He really knows the subject without needing any book. READ AHEAD before his class or you will be completely lost, other than that he is pretty straight forward and clear."
He is great! Lecture is pretty interesting & he\'s a great teacher. Don\'t buy the book!!
"She is the nicest person you will ever meet. I enjoyed her so much for Chem 1 Lab, I took her for Chem 2 Lab. She is very helpful and will answer any question you have. Highly recommended."
"Great depth of knowledge in her field. Took her microbiology class for nursing, and it was clearly a class targeted at us - the majority of the complicated sections were removed, thank god! Don\'t bother with the textbooks, the notes she provides will be all you need. I wish more professors were as easygoing, humorous and helpful as her!"
"Reads powerpoints word for word, very boring lecture. I could read the powerpoints on my own time. She does not help, I have asked on several occasions and have gotten a death stare. Does not cover topics thoroughly, so expect to teach yourself a lot."
Really enjoyed this class. 3 exams & 3 research papers. Exams are a bit tough since they ask very specific questions.Read the book and lecture notes & you\'ll do fine. Plus they\'re online and she curves a good amount. Attendance is mandatory since you need the lecture notes for exams and papers and it counts as a grade! Great Teacher! take her
"She skipped around from chapter to chapter randomly and was highly disorganized. Still, she had clear expectations and was always available at office hours to help with either academic or personal problems. Easy class, if you go and do the volunteer hours."
"I definitely learned a lot in his classes, and the tests were easy enough if you payed attention and absorbed the content, but... I feel like everything he taught could have been condensed into far less time. He rambles on about things irrelevant to the subject quite often. I spent more time hearing about the basketball team he bet on than psyc."
Listen to EVERYBODY below me... this IS THAT CLASS that you dream about taking in college.
"I don\'t understand why so many students dislike Benavidez. His class is not very hard. You have more than enough attempts to the online quizzes to get a 910 or 1010. His lectures are interesting and fun to attend. Sure his exams are challenging, but if you actually study from the study guide he provides and save your quizzes you will be fine!"
He is a really awesome prof. he is very random but he loves to teach and makes micro fun! The material is hard but that is MICRO. Read and ask questions he is very helpful out of class as well! He is very funny too! His tests are pretty average!
Makes sure the class understands the texts. Good choices for texts and essay topics. Really helpful! Wants everyone to improve on his or her writing! Highly Recommended!!
This professor is extremely easy. Just go to class and study all your notes. Only 4 tests and a three-page paper with no works cited.Highly recommend!!
"DU IS THE BOMB! the nicest and most caring man you will EVER meet. Gen chem is harddd at uga regardless, but DU wants to help you. go to his office hours! master the progress checks and form study groups. This is the man to take for chemistry...! you will NOT regret it. one of my favorite professors at uga."
"I find corny people funny and he is hilariously corny funny. Pay attention to the lectures because majority he writes but others he says what he want you to know and you might miss what he said. Overall great guy, great class, pretty much easy too. Lectures fly by."
Not gooood
Great Professor! I loved his teaching style and his lectures were great! He treats everyone with respect and sets you up for success. I learned so much in his class:)
He is very frustrating and get\'s off topic easily. I do not think anyone who is not great at math should take this class. I was lucky because I do well in math. Others are not so lucky. If you can drop his class...drop it.
"He is honestly my favorite professor I\'ve had at EIU. He constantly strives to make sure the class is interested and understands the material and if you ask him for help he will gladly help you. Very strong professor, highly recommend."
Great teacher and overall good guy. Has alot of jokes but doesn\'t allow it to deter from his teaching. If you hate Math then he is a good guy to take.
He is a wonderful teacher.
"Mr. Gallegos is a nice man, but he is very unclear about his teaching. The tests were cofusing, they did not match with the content on the textbook or the studyguide. One good thing was that there was not much homework. Only 10 questions a week, but the homework was not clear so it would take you along time to figure out what he wanted."
"Doesn\'t treat students fairly or respectfully. Walked out of an exam while most students were still working - he failed to communicate that the time was up, so we had to sprint after him to hand in our exams. He also put 3 chapters on the final that we did not properly cover in class. Essentially, his students got punished for his mistakes."
She was a good teacher! The course was very lecture heavy and the material was very dense. With that though she was great at explaining the concepts so that the students could understand. All homework/online assignments were very easy and not too time consuming. Her tests are hard though and require attention to every little detail of a concept
"Great professor, interesting material - horrible class. The most reading I\'ve ever done for any class, and I\'m an English major. If you have a light schedule, take at your own risk, but otherwise, avoid. Grade depends mostly on 2 horrifying exams that are based almost exclusively on the excessive reading material. Again, great teacher, awful class."
"I tried his 4 week, weekend class. I thought he assumed students knew way too much for being a 101 class. I had to drop him and retake it."
He is a very good teacher but his tests are tough for Physics 227. You will be doing a lot of derivations of very complicated formulas for his tests. He does give practice exams before each test but the last test of the semester was completely different from the practice exam and extremely difficult. Use his office hours he is there to help.
Class broken up into three exams worth the same amount of credit. Some of the matrial is really dry. I did well on the first 2 exams that I read for and were also lecture heave. The final was based on the book which is why I did not get an A. My couse load was heavy. I did not have time time to read everything for evey class. Some toppics are good.
Great teacher!
"Very easy and nice professor. She cares a lot about her students and tries to make everything easy for them. She\'s an easy grader even though there are essay questions on the exams, she doesn\'t mark off a lot when you make a good number of mistakes."
"Crazy amounts of field tripping, lots of freedom to do research you care about, very relaxed. His walking classes are logistical nightmares, though... too many students to hear him talking over traffic oftentimes."
"I\'ve taken two of his classes, and I\'ve relly enjoyed them both. Everything that everyone else said I definitely agree with, he is great!"
"Bolduc is awesome! His class focused on discussion format, and instead of textbooks, we used more interesting nonfiction books that had more focus. His quizzes are easy... just make sure you pay attention in class and do the writing assignments, and you\'ll be fine. It was the most fun class I had all year!"
"Real Good Guy, Doesn\'t BS you, tells you what you have to do, then helps you out along the way! I would highly recomend him!"
This is was the easiest class i\'ve taken. He gives you worksheets and does all of the problems out in class. The test is the same worksheet with different numbers and you can use your notes. He doesn\'t teach but its basically just copying formulas.
"Insightful teacher who will really challenge students to think deeper, but helpful and a fair grader. Very accessible outside of class, not to mention drop dead gorgeous. Some of the allure might be the intelligence though. Recommend!"
Loved her. I feel she is a fair grader and she definitely gives second chances if you are late with work. She does everything step by step so it will be a benefit to you if you do all the work on time. She was very helpful and gave a lot of individual time to students.
"Capt. Kerr is a teacher that can make anyone laugh during his class. He is very clear with the subjects of study, because he has examples of everything that he teaches. He is my favorite teacher at the college."
"Easy to get a good grade if you work for it. She has you write a lot of papers, but she\'s available for help and will give the occasional extension for you if something comes up. Very organized with what is due when and gives you enough time to complete assignments. Caring and funny."
"He\'s a nice person, but I had no way to understand his accent. He did not use black board buy only wrote on transparet stuff - that made us very difficult to undertsand what he tried to explain."
"This was my first time taking an online class, and I gotta say, it was really easy. Read the textbook, answer questions on the practice tests before they close, and review the different maps and take the easy map quizzes. The practice quiz questions will be on the midterm and final. Email him with any questions, he is always willing to help."
"He is very entertaining. you can tell if he doesn\'t like your art (says ""oh, that\'s nice"") but is very uplifting. I mainly just showed up signed in and left. Very nice and is willing to help. i would recommend this teacher."
He makes thermodynamics fun!
"All the accounting tests and homeworks are the same regardless of professor, however Petacchi is the best professor"
He was an awesome teacher! I am taking 27 now and wish I had him! He once saw that everyone had a hard time on a test and let us turn in corrections of the ones we got wrong and gave us half the points credit that we missed. He also gave a two part final... half was worth 60% and was take home! Take him... He\'s the best!
10 out of 10! i wish i had her for everything else
When I think of Leigh Hall\'s class I have anxiety attacks. She would complain to the students that the we assignments submitted were incorrect. Students felt uncomfortable asking questions because she humiliated them for not understanding the subject being taught. The textbook was helpful but Professor Hall said the textbook was incorrect.
"although his class is hard and its not an easy A, he is really helpful and is funny. sometimes you can get bored in his class. he is willing to answer all your questions and he is REALLY clear on what he wants in your papers."
"Joseph ROCKS!! Very smart-i think he can solve any math problems! he is very nice, and his notes are extremely clear and organized!! teaches at right pace, and midterms are challenged. But he scales at the end, which is the best!!"
"Nice guy and learned a lot. However, do not take him unless you are willing to do the work. You get homework every night. I would recommend for an english major."
"Philosophy of the Human Person: Maria Seifert-Wolter is the most phenomenal teach I have ever had or will have. She is challenging, but only in an extremely reasonable way that is meant to stretch you as a person. Her lectures are gripping, interactive, and she can explain even the most difficult concepts to a philosophy-ignorant person. 5 stars."
"Terrible professor, worst I ever had at Loyola. I cannot believe Loyola hired and continues to keep someone like her around. She is no doubt a smart woman, but is not fit for teaching."
"I agree wit the others. Wheres all the equipment promised and suppose to be used. All I saw was computers. And we didnt use those enough to finish projects. No matter, no one fails ever with Kisner."
"These comments are quite unfair. Just because you actually have to put time and effort into her class in order to do well automatically makes her a bad teacher? If you read the book, go to class and put some energy into the class then you\'ll do just fine. She makes you work, deal with it, especially b/c she seems to care a lot about the material."
"Vietnam Veteran and superb professor. Commands respect, fair. I went through the entire semester without learning ANY of his political beliefs, which is a downright admirable quality in ANYONE. Thanks Sir."
"I have had him for several courses, enough to get a handle on his teaching style. He gets very excited about what he is teaching and goes 90 miles an hour. If you ask a question, make sure he understand EXACTLY what you are asking, or he won\'t answer your question correctly. Tests rely on in class material, and he\'s lenient on homeworks."
"She\'s a very nice lady with a beautiful accent, but it\'s hard to understand her sometimes, and basically you had to read 50+ pages just to understand what was being discussed in class."
Took 95 in the summer for 5 weeks. Overall it was an easy class. I liked how he taught. He teaches more by examples than lecture. Im taking him again for 111
"Do not take this class unless you have to. He will assign you over 600 pages to read from several articles (and that\'s only up until the midterm) and then test you on a topic that was only mentioned in one paragraph. His lectures are extremely long and boring, so even reviewing slides for an exam doesn\'t help. He acts like the class is a 400-level."
"Great personality, fun class. A litle strict on writing but you will become a better writer on papers because of it. Learned a lot"
"If you have insomnia I highly recommend this class, doesn\'t help, very confusing, I feel I\'ve learned absolutely nothing. RUN..."
Professor Enjolras cares tremendously for the students in her classes. This is much clearer in upper level courses whereas in 301 she might scare you from continuing with French. She is a truly a gem but you have to be patient as her teaching style is unlike that of typical American professors. Get frustrated but remember that it\'s worth it.
It\'s been 5 years since I had Prof. Chung. He is one of the best professors I\'ve ever had. I\'m in graduate school now and the relationship between professors and grad students is much like how Chung treats undergrads at Etown; like real people who he expects to do the work and participate. Take advantage of his knowledge and enthusiasm!
Professor Rio makes sure students understand the material and how to do the work. She cares about her students as individuals and to just as a class.
"He is very easy. Don\'t bother going to class, just have someone sign you in. if you do go, just bring other work with you and he\'ll give you specific study guides for the test, plus you can ""bring notes"" for the essay."
"Boring lectures. Crazy scary laughs and jokes that make no sense. Loves UBC and Elon Musk. Midterm is abstract and difficult. No final for summer class. Recommend to start final report ASAP! But if you can, don\'t take this course with him."
"I learned so much throughout this course. Professor Murray may put up a challenge, but in the end, its all worth it."
"I took Dr. Dean for BIO 426526726 aka Neurobiology. This is a graduate undergrad COMBINED course. It is MEANT TO BE HARD. He is a very detailed professor who expects A LOT out of his students. If you are up to the challenge, then this course and prof is great. Don\'t expect any easy As. I aced his class (only undergrad to do so in fall14)."
"I found the professor to be easy to work with the the projects we not ""out of this world"" difficult. Over all, a good experience."
Great teacher.very supportive. She lets you out early but if class big on speech nights you might not.great for working adults. Can retake test she go with highest score.
"Great Teacher, french class was not boring. Very nice guy."
"Amazing. One of the most caring, sincere, funny professors I\'ve ever had. Always wants you to leave class happy! Responds to e-mails quickly, and has been teching for 45 years. Take him for italian! His goal is 50 years of teaching, take him before he retires!!"
"Mr. Nikkel is very nice and a good instructor. He teaches mainly using powerpoints, and he incorporates some humor into them, so it is not all boring. He also gives 20 points quizes through out the semester, and the final is open book. Take him for psychology 1!"
"Professor Suranovic made a simple subject nearly impossible. His lectures are almost incomprehensible, it\'s sometimes better to not even go. Everyone I\'ve spoken to says their TA\'s aren\'t helpful, and everyone fails raw score. You don\'t learn much in this class, mostly just a headache. Would recommend taking Foster\'s micro course over this."
Easy class. Bad thing that it was at 8AM and on the other side of campus and was not tolerant to late students. He lectured in a very organized and non-confusing way. Totally worth it!!
This is my favorite class of my first year! I love how Dr. Hoston teaches.
Easiest history professor at cscc.
Had him for 120 and 320. Goes off of his powerpoint. Exams are really hard BUT has a great curve. I\'d rather take him than Kidane for Cell Bio :-/
"This class is so easy! She is really nice and if you pay attention, her lectures will be very clear."
"Theres really no point in going to the lectures but make sure that you do all the labs and homeworks they add up like you wouldnt believe LOOK OVER the old exams for practice especially the CHEM 107, majority of exams question come from there ... but overall Cadenhead is a very nice guys and can be very helpful when you go to his office hours."
"I enjoyed her as a professor, it was a great gen ed to take, plus you learn a lot of GRE vocab words! She is relatively flexible and accomodating. Lectures are interesting because they are interactive. I have a new appreciation for poetry."
"Definitely the nicest teacher at Pratt by far. I learned alot from his class, and I never felt like taking a knife to my throat during or after class"
"Dr. Byrd is so helpful to students, she explains things perfect, her expectations are clearly stated and her tests are straightforward. The class is not easy by any means but if you study and attend class, you\'ll be successful."
This woman is more than willing to help anyone out! The only class I actually think that I attended everyone!
Nice teacher. Tons of busy work.
"I am taking Accounting Procedures with him and he is really a great teacher. Will always stay after class to give you extra help. I recommend him highly, especially if accounting is something you find diifucult to understand."
she is not teaching. she just go through the material. She uses many TAs. You might become a TA in her class. Some lecturer is irrelevant.
"Meets 4 times a week at 8am, you either get it all or get none of it....tests pretty hard"
"Writing intensive-Christian is a rare and wonderful man.He truly wants to help. I suggest letting him, because you\'ll learn alot!, and he wants that.Attendance and decent respect-no: texting or web surfing in class, or tardiness. Gives plenty of xtra credit-even for showing up.Passionate re: topic, caring to students, available. I\'d take em again."
"Great class , well structed and will help you if your willing to take the intiative to talk to him. He helpred me out to pass the class. Very knowledgeable about the industry and will often talk about industry trends."
"The professor was excellent for the subject, however, I found the subject really boring. There are 4 open note tests, all averaged below 70%. I do not think she curved the tests or class, the grade i received was about my grade without a curve, we never got the final back but i know i did exceptionally well on it."
"If you rely on the notes in class you fail. You have to do the problems in the back of the book to do just okay on the exams. He ask tricky questions on the exam things he never went over. He skips some of lecture because he says we already covered this. Steals other professors PowerPoints online from other universities ""notes from uni of Florida"""
"I feel very nostalgic about Connally, probably explains some of the rating. I did not know you could leave comments years after the course. Hope you\'re doing great, Bob, you set me on my course."
"Firstly, I would like to tell that she is really caring students and helping them in every way. She has a knowledge about so many topics. Therefore, we always write about interesting topics. If you do your homework, there is no reason to get lower on your exams or quizzes. I strongly encourage you to take her class."
"There is A LOT of reading to do. 400 page reader + 4-6 novels/books. Films are interesting documentaries, but you watch it on your own time. I never knew what to expect on the tests, so many people scored badly. But the ""homework"" (reading summaries) is easy and the essay (""plagarized"") is TIME-CONSUMING but graded generously. Easy to fall behind."
"""One of the coolest""? She has been THE best TA I have had, even though she has the most enthusiasm for the subject that one could possibly have, she doesn\'t give you a hard time if you don\'t understand. She is VERY helpful and wants you to learn. Also has a great sense of humor, and CUTE! :)"
He\'s very realistic and helpful
I do not recommend her at all. she like to score down students just for scoring down. I will not drop her class only because it is required for the Associate. if you cannot find anybody else teaching the same course she is giving take it with her and make it pass fail.
"He is the worst teacher I have ever had. He will waste the entire 2 hours of class showing you how to do problems by hand when you can do it on a calc in 5 sec. He isn\'t understanding and often compares the class to the top student. So if one person understands the problem and no one else does, he doesn\'t see a reason to keep explaining. HE SUCKS!"
"The class is easy even if you have no interest in science! She is funny and quirky and keeps things interesting. The tests consist of 60 MC and 2 essays in one class time, but they are easy enough to finish on time. You will need to study but shes always willing to help! I recommend her class as an easy science credit."
"Take a nap before class because you WILL fall asleep and you WILL miss important and confusing topics he covers. READ THE ASSIGNED CHAPTER BEFORE LECTURE, it makes it a lot easier to understand. You get to make your own cheat sheet for every test, which you\'ll most likely depend on. Goes through problems thoroughly but fast, so pay attention!"
He\'s a sweet guy and has a lot of insight on a variety of topics but sometimes he just loses steam. he\'s not hard but sometimes the classes were hard to sit through.
"Classes were discussion groups. Never learned anything constructive, just others opinions. Did not receive any good tools for policy development."
"She really knows her information but doesn\'t present it in a enjoyable manner. Learned very little. Tests are very, very hard, even when you study. The only good thing is that she offers about 50 points of easy extra credit."
"Shes a very nice person, pretty decent teacher as well. Her class is easy as pay attention &see the required plays. Reading the book helps (she has 3 pop quizzes throughout the semester) her test reviews dont help but her tests are pretty easy..she gives a bonus question in every test and some questions are opinion based so they cant be wrong:)"
Whoever says she is an idiot is obviously an idiot themselves. She is an awesome teacher who cares about her students. She cant be an idiot if she has a masters in psychology...hater!
"Great guy, he does not get off topic ever but he doesnt have to because the information is very interesting. he really cares about his students. Overall this class is great and I am so glad I took it. I would take it again if I could!"
"Hendrickson is great...has been very helpful post-graduation as well. i highly recommend taking any class with him, especially an independent study!"
"I like to give teachers a lot of slack for what they have to do but she was not a good teacher in so many ways!! She did not know what she was teaching, she would literally read from the powerpoints and not add anything else to her curriculum. She never once answered a question that the students would ask. She did not prepare the class for tests an"
"Professor Kaplan is literally the most interesting person in the world. Her passion for everything Scandinavian so is contagious. Favorite class I\'ve ever taken ever. She expects a whole lot though, this is the real deal. And a warning: she will not answer emails, and I\'ve heard she is not always at her office hours. So good luck contacting her."
Get on her good side and shell give you a better grade then if you show up and stay quiet.
"Tests are easy, but homework is hard. Takes many days to complete the homework because not only is there an excessive amount of problems, but much of the homework content is not actually taught during class. She uses the easiest examples to show you, and then you are left to figure out the rest. I basically taught myself all semester long. Just no."
"Prof. Lenaghan is literally the best professor I\'ve taken in my life. he honestly cares about your success(he will go way ad beyond). In Class, do the essays based on 2books and you\'ll pass. EASY ""A ""Class but the lessons are for your personal growth plus HIS LETTER OF RECOMMENDATION ARE THE BEST !! If there is space in his class , Just take him."
Dr. Costley does not know how to manage classroom time effectively! He talks and talks (boring) and goes beyond our regular class time. We get LATE all the time because of this. Dr. Costley is friendly person but I wouldn\'t take another course with him!
interesting
"Dr. Whelan is a fantastic lecturer who makes her criteria and expectations very clear! The organization of the course was flawless, interesting and even funny (which can be hard in sociology). The reading responses are a GREAT way to actually encourage you to read - which, believe me, you\'ll appreciate. I would take any course with Dr. Whelan!"
Better than most professors.
He was a terrible teacher and wasnt helpful at all. I wouldnt take him at all because he doesnt explain anything and if you ask him questions he just confuses more than before. Unless you can teach yourself everything about Algebra dont take him.
"Funny as hell, and offers a LOT of extra credit. All you have to do to pass the class is pay attention, take notes, and to the Criminal Justice Interactive reviews!"
"Spectacular professor. He literally sat down and told us everything to write on the final, over the course of the semester. Would highly recommend his class if you are willing to go and pay attention. As a bonus, he\'s hilarious if you catch his jokes."
Very smart man; but unclear examples. Rushes through lectures to fast to actually teach. Switched to a new book which is just as bad as his teaching. The book has limited/no worked out examples so it\'s difficult to teach yourself using the book. Expect the tests to be nothing like the homework assigned and him to be shocked when grades are bad.
"Best professor out there! He doesn\'t put up with disrespect, makes learning psych fun and very interesting. He\'s very uplifting, funny, extremely helpful, and a good guy. Would do anything to help his students!"
"She let me turn my paper in late when my grandmother died, without penalty. She likes to read her favorite essays aloud. While she made us write a lot, I do feel that my writing is actually better. Also say nothing **** or homophobic: she turns red with anger and will then pretend you are not in the room."
"Prof.Schopf\'s courses are extemely popular, and quite large, so having a good, responsive TA in her courses is critical to success! Beyond that, she is a witty, engaging lecturer, and expects her students to be at the top of their game-prepared to discuss and write intelligently about the work at hand. Be prepared-Slackers need not apply!!!"
"all quiz answers can be found online,although you might not even have to do that b/c they\'re pretty simple. the quizzes are timed. There are 3 exams, each have 10 essay questions. TAKES FOREVER TO DO.she is an easy grader and as long as your answers are from the book you\'ll be fine. got a 100 on each exam! take her class if you need sociology!:)"
"Kulkarni\'s Astronomy class was very interesting. Her lectures are material-heavy, but pay attention and study for the tests and they are definitely doable. Kulkarni learns everyone\'s name during the semester and is obviously very kind and caring towards her students. I would gladly take another class with her."
"Best professor ever! She teaches the material so well and helped me whenever I needed it. She\'s fun and interesting, and I loved the math groups!"
Can be very moody and unprofessional
"Great, if can keep up with her syllabus changes. She laughes it off if you call her on it. She probably has a disclaimer printed on her syllabus regarding the future changes."
"She\'s very selective to who she likes, and treats people unfairly. If you actually wanna be able to say one word to your friends then take another course, not this. Oh and don\'t anwser in middle of her talking, she might get frusterated."
Omg boring professor.... easy class but you\'ll be falling asleep. If you\'re looking for a more challenging class were you actually learn this is not the class you should be taking. Professor is really mellow...... does not look like a police officer or someone who\'s been in law enforcement at all.
"Super easy. Gotta show up to labs and tests. Gives power points ahead of time. Very nice, easy-going. Tons of extra credit opportunities."
"Dr.Tatum seems very genuine.I feel that she allows the students to control the class at times becaus she is so nice which can be distracting to those who only want to hear her and not the ""know it all"" students. Their is a reason she is the teacher. Great lady though. I advise taking her for your computer curriculem."
"Didn\'t agree with a word she said, but respected her anyway. Discussed Bush more than was appropriate for a Latin American history class, still smart& fair. Always available for help on the 50 million research assignments she gives.Take if u love history."
"Go to his office hours well-prepared with questions. If you take good notes in lecture, do the book problems, and go to office hours you will not only make the grade but a friend. Doig is a rare, kind soul. He wrote me a fantastic letter of recommendation to medical school--and practically everyone else from CofC in my first year class!"
"Dr. Kelley was by far the hardest teacher I have had so far in nursing school. Even though she was my clinical instructor, she expected more out of you than any other instructor. If you paid attention and always willing to learn then she is defiantly GREAT by far! During her clinicals she challenges you with your paper work and quizzes."
"I\'m not a Physics major, didn\'t enjoy physics in high school, and I wasn\'t excited about College Physics. (I\'ve changed!) Curtis is an amazing teacher; he\'s extremely passionate about what he does and amazing at it too. His explanations are crystal clear and he is always willing to help. I enjoyed every bit of his class. Would strongly recommend."
Demands a lot from her students. Expect a lot of work. She doesn\'t bring any experiences or anything refreshing to the classroom to help student\'s understanding of the material. She just regurgitates the text back to you. Attending class is like reading the textbook all over again. You practically have to teach yourself the material.
"One of the best professors in the library science program at Queens. She has a ton of energy and puts a lot into her lectures. Her exams are difficult but fair. She offers practical and constructive advice on papers and overall, helped me to become a better paper writer. Highly recommended!"
"I am taking Mark\'s history class. You can learn a lot if you actually listen and take notes during lecture, but be prepared to write five pages of notes per lecture. There is a lot of reading, but they\'re easy reads. He does not hand out A\'s very easily; you have to earn them."
Good teacher very consistant! Make sure and read the book and get quizes in on time. I would take him again.
"I took his online film appreciation class. It was much more time consuming than I would have hoped/expected for a genEd class. His quizzes are pretty tricky. Overall, I would say that this class is harder than I would hope for an appreciation class. The movies that he picks for you to watch are pretty good though."
"LOVED her!! She just started teaching this class, but she was awesome. Class was supposed to last an hour and 15 mins, but she would usually only lecture for about 30 or 45 mins. All of the powerpoints were straightforward and to the point. You have to study everything in detail, but quizzes and tests were pretty easy! She gives extra credit too!"
"Wow, this man is amazing! He is by far the nicest man you will ever meet. He tries to help his students out whenever possible. He is able to teach you physics in the most simple way! I recommend this professor to anyone who needs to take a science, you will not regret it!"
"Good class, pretty easy class he is also nice to talk to, take his class if you want an easy A, although there are a few presentations, it isn\'t too hard! Not bad for a 400 level class ;)"
"Clark is a WONDERFUL lecturer. However, in order to actually do well on the tests, you DO have to read the textbook. Clark does give an optional assignment to take the place of one of the tests though, and it\'s just a rather easy poster. There are 3 short assignments too, worth 10 pts. Overall Clark is a wonderful professor!"
awesome guy. loves starbucks. knows a whole lot about art history. had a blast in his class.
"Amazing teacher with an outstanding amount of knowledge of Government. Great ability to actually teach her students, rather than just having them pass (like most teachers at Northlake). A+ all the way. I\'ve referred her to many other students looking to take Govt I and II."
is completely weird.. too many assignments due one after another.. kind of trailer trash / redneck.. but nice in the end.. easy teacher.. go to all classes and do all assignments.. easy grade JUST TRY AND STAY AWAKE!
"The professor is a nice older lady who is authentically passionate about philosophy. Unfortunately she is a huge rambler. Her lectures are just a series of rambles. One after another. Incredibly, boring."
"I have no idea what he taught me, just have to suck this class up and get enough to pass, lots of teaching yourself and trying to learn from book."
I LOVED this class. You are required to take a PFW class at some point during your time at BSU and I will truly miss having Gene! He is super chill and laid back and gives a good rotation of things you do during class! Plus he is a really funny guy!
he makes no sense when trying to teach and he puts you down a lot
"Eye-opening lectures. Values your opinion. Discussion-focused class. Too much emphasis on Mexico as case study. Lots of readings but there are ways to get around these (wait till he hands out exam questions then highlight the parts from the readings that are related to the question, OR read book reviews instead of the actual books). An A is doable."
"He would be more well suited to teach in a high school setting. I know he\'s nearing a career exit but I could picture that working out for him. But in a role where learning is more valuable and efficient, like a major university, he just doesn\'t cut it. I know he\'s probably close to retirement but he should consider going to the high school level."
"The best teacher I have ever had. She cares about her students. She gives a lot of HW but it is easy and so helpful for the test. If you do your HW by yourself, I assure you that you will get an easy A."
If you even think of taking MTH with her consider yourself screwed from day 1. TERRIBLE! TERRIBLE! TERRIBLE!I can\'t even being to explain how horrible she is. She told my class that CMU students come in as Freshman comatoast and graduate comatoast.
"Great prof. who clearly describes everything during his lectures. You know exactly what to study based on his slide focus. Course readings not necessary, slides have all required material. Didn\'t do a single reading and finished with an A-, easy class if you have some common sense and show up. Majority of students finished with a B, no failures."
"Funny guy, boring class :) The only marks received are Midterm, Term paper and Exam, so there is some lack of clarity of standing going into the exam. Was allowed to use textbooks in exams! YAY!"
"Prof. Malloy hadn\'t taught this class in a while but he still came through. I took him in Spring 2011 for BADM 101 and got an ""A"". He doesn\'t give ""D\'s or F\'s"" and the reason is everyone loves his class. He\'s exciting and he loves to ""CLOWN"" so don\'t try to show out because he\'s a bully and you will get shamed in class. Overall he\'s EXCELLENT!!!"
i took him for numerous courses and enjoyed him at first but this semester he was so rude and weird. Is he going through menopause or what?
Nice guy but he gives you a lot of material to absorb in a short period of time. Test are not multiple choice and you have to show how you came up with the sollution. He gives you a lot of homework and does not give you any study guides for test. He is fast in responding to any email you send. If you miss 1 class you\'ll be lost.
"Boring unengaging lectures. 4tests worth 25% each. If he doesn\'t go over the study guide before the test, you might do ok."
No homework and she posts lecture notes. A very easy class all you have to do is study a bit before a test. Everyone saying she\'s a bad teacher is high.
"He\'s probably the best discussion moderator at Hendrix and seems to really care about articulating and sharing ideas. Sometimes it is annoying how finicky he is about attendance, lateness and paper formatting, but he\'s still a great teacher."
"Very WIERD!!!! Forces class to watch old Woody Allen movies and then do papers relating to the ""Big 6 Questions"" as he calls them. Very hard on papers, rarely gives A\'s."
"Dose not make an effort to help students who are struggling with class. If a student dose bad on one of his test he laughs at them and tells them to drop class. He thinks he is the ""worlds best"" programmer, making fun of other people\'s code etc.Grading System is: If works 80%; if code to his standard 90%; not possible to get 100% apparently."
"Professor Jenning is a new teacher, and still getting his legs under him. He makes the class way too easy for an upper division Biology class. He can spend an hour explaining something everyone knows, or that should only take 5 minutes to explain. Nonetheless, he tries to make a class where everyone can succeed. \r \r Easy enough to be boring."
Dude is crazy awesome at teaching martial arts.
"Great professor, really down to earth and entertaining. Your work is cut out for you in the syllabus. Dont buy the book, you can find it online easily (check sbu reddit). Homework, which is once a week, is easy credit (you have multiple attempts to get it right) and final is optional."
Is wonderful professor I wish all the professors good like him.
"This teacher is FANTASTIC! He is funny and makes the class interesting. I usually cannot stand math but I actually learned something and had a good time. He does not take attendance so it is up to you whether or not you attend class which I thought was cool, I mean this is college not high school, right?! Anyways, great guy!"
"She is so nice, and she really wants to help you do well. Do the extra credit, it can really help. If you have questions, ASK! She is so nice about it, and doesn\'t make you feel like a fool. Tests are kind of random though."
"Teaches through story telling and using his own experiances for examples. He\'s easy going, laid back and fun. I loved his class."
This class was useless. Mr. Abcarian does not adequately prepare for his classes. If you are actually looking to learn I would avoid taking him.
This was my favourite class by far and that was probably down to Laurila\'s teaching. He is hilarious and so helpful. This class really helped me with my writing and introduced me to film studies. Such a fun class.
"This course is horrible. His lectures are incredibly boring and he drones on and on. All the quizzes have less than 10 questions and a time limit. Good luck because even if you did all the required reading, watched his lectures, and all the extras he posts, you will probably still have a hard time. Getting a 40 on a quiz is common."
I read all the reviews on here...I can see where most students are coming from as far as the condescending attitude. That\'s what I thought of her when I first started the class. She talks slow and the lectures are boring. BUT I did find her to be a very helpful teacher (when you ask for help)! Overall the subject matter is important...
"Prof Bishop is a great guy and means well. His style of teaching is difficult and when questions are asked he has a hard time answering them and you will sit there for a minute trying to figure out his response. You\'d be better off learning from the book because that\'s the only thing he uses to teach, he uses the book more than actually instructing"
Excellent professeur. Ne sous-estimez pas son intelligence ni la v\xc3\xb4tre.
"I had Dann in small group for People and the Env. and he was so easy. We had great discussions in class. He never once pushed his beliefs on others. He\'s not a bum, I was amazed that he was able to teach class and still go through cemo for his cancer."
Really nice guy. The test comes straight from his notes... and he has wicked ties! hah
Half the class dropped. Difficult course on classical music from 1900-1970.
Very fun and sassy.
"Had this class for summer, easy A. Show up everyday to get a C and do the extra credit. I had enough points to get an A so I didn\'t have to study for the final."
"A fine Christian gentleman. Not my easiest class or my favorite, but Dr. Hardy was a good person to have class under."
Would not recommend talking this professor for any course. Wait for someone else to teach it.
"Has no ability to teach, let alone be at DEAN!!"
Can be a bit cocky sometimes.
"Absolutley aweful. He will never return your only three tests of the semester, which happen to be your only grades. His tests are hard and do not reflect on his lectures. Will kill your GPA"
"This dude is an amazing teacher. He makes himself available at almost anytime to help answer questions. During exams, he extends his office hours and allows self-paced exam times so you don\'t feel rushed. He is flexible and understanding of the responsibilities of nontraditional students. Really made learning a difficult subject much easier."
"Very, good teacher. Test and to the point made an A. Lectures are clear also and you know what he wants of you as a student"
"Such a great teacher. Always helps you and creates a safe, healthy and fun environment. She always gives you a chance to catch up and makes learning fun. I enjoyed her class so much and would definitely recommend her to everyone. Five stars!!!"
Great instructor! Funny and goofy! Class was fun and easy overall. Not too hard on missed homework or attendance. Grades easy.
"Boring, confusing lecures, and really difficult exams. Also, professor assigns a lot of extra reading...pages and pages about his boring research on testosterone and personality. Beware...don\'t take this class...take social psych instead."
"Sarena does give a lot of work, but when you consider it is an accelarted 5 week class, you should probably expect more work than usual. Enjoy the topics that were covered in this class-very interesting stuff. I found that I was never bored and always excited about the reading assignments. Great instructor!"
"She is a good Professor. Lots of HW, and you must read all your chapters on your own to understand. She does not use the book for lecture but makes the topics easy to understand. Take notes in class and on your own. Ask questions, and don\'t miss class. You will do fine."
took her online stay away!!!!
"Not my favorite class, but it was pretty fun learning science that focused on national parks rather than a regular boring geology. Not a hard class, just show up, take notes, and study them."
GREATEST PROFESSER EVER!
"Nice teacher, really wants the class to succeed. Many stumble and slur a bit. Overall okey teacher if you just need to freshen up on your math. Also, he lets you get away with being late or absent."
I looked forward to going to these lectures every day of class. Well prepared and very knowledgeable.
"Rare exceptionally talented professor. Enthusiastic, not judgmental, obviously cares about his students. Excellent, well prepared lectures. He gives it everything he\'s got. With effort, it is probable that an excellent grade can be achieved."
"I CAN\'T STAND HER!!!!!! SHE\'S ANNOYING, AND COULDN\'T TEACH GRADE ONE IF HER LIFE DEPENDED ON IT... How did she ever get this job? I don\'t even want to know............"
"she is the best! always makes her lectures easy and fun! if you take good notes and pay attention in class you dont need the book. the test are easy, if you do the review (which you take home). overall she is the best teacher i had this semester . i wish every professor were like her!!!"
There is so many group projects which is irrevelant to the course subject being taught. I am very ashamed to be part of his students mainly because his lecture is very boring it makes me fall asleep the entire class period
He\'s a great teacher. It\'s a hard class. One of the hardest classes at SFA - I\'m told. He\'s willing to help and is a nice guy. Gives partial credit for problems
"Note: the class number has changed. It was physics for poets. This professor was one of the most inspirational people I ever met at LMU. He went out of his way to support my extracurricular interests. This dude is seriously stand-up. If you have the chance, drop what you\'re doing to take this guy\'s class. You\'ll get more out of it than you put in."
"I would try to avoid him at all costs, especially for senior seminar."
Good instructor. He tries to do his best all the time.
Like a bad rash... A Samirash...
"He\'s a very kind and helpful person. However, he expects A LOT of work from you so prepared to do a lot of extra work to get good grades. He can also talk a lot and vaguely in the sense that it\'s hard to take notes and remember everything he tells you."
She is GREAT!! I would definately recommend taking her!! She makes the subjects very enjoyable and she is a great person to just talk to about anything!
"She is very knowledgeable and passionate, however the class is a bit disorganized. She assigns A LOT of reading, and then covers only a fraction of it in class. You never really get the feel like you\'re getting too in depth to any of the readings. Option of taking a midterm (in class) and a take home final, or writing a term paper."
Excellent prof! Dr. Hull is very fun to listen to and gives highly detailed verbal notes. His knowledge of the history of science is fascinating and he\'s always willing to engage in discussions about anything relevant in class. All questions and comments are taken seriously by him- he will never be condescending to any of his students.
"He is one of my best lecturers, amazing lectures, extra credits, very helpful, he is a good teacher and obviously passionate about his job."
Oliver is an amazing professor. I had him for Human Sexuality and it was my favorite class. He presents information in a way that doesn\'t even feel like learning. Strongly recommended!
"Stieglitz is a very knowledgeable instructor in his field of study. The lectures are long as any 100 level course, which usually means boring. You don\'t have to read the textbook or articles to pass (but it would help). Lectures are online. Go to study sessions and you\'ll pass. The lectures can be long and boring, but they can be very interesting."
Teacher is very clear and makes sure you understand the material. She doesn\'t take BS but she\'s awesome. Will take her for A&P next semester.
"Dr. Sommo is very knowledgeable in regards to sociology, however lectures are so long that we never cover all of the exam chapters in class. Thus, leaving the students responsible to teach themselves 3/4 chapters on their own by reading the text book. Tests are LONG AND HARD! No one gets A\'s on exams, even when they are curved by a lot."
"Very intelligent but doesn\'t explain very well for students to understand. Then he goes more in depth and gets very complicated. Very nice man, but I wouldn\'t recommend for 101. Other chem profs were easier to follow and awarded more points and extra credit."
"Moves through sections very quickly. Assigns tons of homework, some of which isn\'t useful at all. Graded homeworks are long and only 2 problems (sometimes out of 100) are actually looked at and graded. Exams are extremely difficult. Will help if you come to him."
This class changed my life! He is a huge advocate for the GSCOM program and with good reason. Anyone who doubts the employability of this degree did not apply themselves adequately. Dr. Ahire is one of the best professors at the Moore School and has a passion and drive which sets the tone for the entire program. A life long mentor to many students.
Quite vague and unorganized but an incredibly loveable man.
"I do not recommend Rogers because he has no set structure.He gives a syllabus that is a guideline at the beginning but it has nothing about when assignments are due, what you are reading, ect.He gave us 2 papers and grades if you do have the same opinion.Basically state verbatim what his opinion is and you get a good grade."
"She isn\'t a good teacher. She is difficult to understand and her handwriting is horrible . She doesn\'t give much, if any, partial credit on exams. You ask her to go over more examples and she won\'t. She has also made mistakes in her examples, which the class had to call her out on. DO NOT TAKE HER!!"
"He has to be the worst teacher I have ever encountered. Not only are his teaching skills bad, but he is also a mean person. His midterm and final are impossible and he only gives those two grades all semester.I do not know anyone who likes him."
"Nice guy... take home test/quizes, five one page written homework assignment, and a book report. Only draw back he doesn\'t let you out early if you have him for a night class like other prof\'s."
"Clem is personable, knows his material, and will take time to clarify and explain concepts. This is a programming class and, if you can\'t / don\'t do the work, you will not get a good grade."
"Great professor! He was really funny, helpful, and clear with his lectures. I definitely learned a lot."
"Latta is the man, Copy whatever he writes on the board and you will do fine. Takes attendance whenever he feels like it. Tests are very easy, and ever test has extra credit. Gives a lot of extra credit."
"Took a d-term class for 3 hours a day, 5 days a week for 3 weeks. Hardest part was staying awake. He\'s a good guy, but a hard, PICKY teacher. Gives decent feedback on papers but class time seems to be flooded with pointless opinions from other students. It was obvious people didn\'t want to be in class and were stressed about the final at the end."
"Excellent, Excellent teacher! great at explaining the material and making it relate to life. Wish he was still at A&M so i could take more of his classes"
"Should take another teacher beside her. She does not teach what you are expecting. Reading a lot, but exam is difficult. What the hell teacher like her, she does not give you a change to improve your grade. I \'m not kidding, if you let your phone ring in her class, she will deduct your grade right away ! Really mean teacher ! DO NOT TAKE HER CL"
"If you\'re looking for an easy gpa booster option, don\'t take this class. The voice she uses in lectures is so mellow that you can easily drift off to sleep. She reads off powerpoints. The material is overwhelming and the tests are tricky. Unless you are actually interested in primates and can take a lot of reading, do not take her class!"
"This professor is the worst professor I have ever taken. His lectures are terrible, and you can\'t actually read what he writes on the board, but that\'s the stuff you have to memorize to do well in the class. He marks you off for stuff even though he didn\'t ask for that stuffYou won\'t learn anything taking this class. Bad professor, horrible person"
"This professor is the reason I changed my major from psychology. Avoid him at all costs. I went to every class, attended tutoring sessions his know nothing TA held, and still couldn\'t figure out what I was supposed to be learning. Tests are based on lecture material but the textbook is the only reason I passed. I S/U the class."
"im not the best at math but this is rediculously tough. he isn\'t bad though, not an easy class by any means."
"She is great Professor. You are not going receive the feedback on your paper. All you need to do is to do your best to write the papers and do not skip the classes, and you will be okay. Three papers assignments, 2 group in class projects. She is very smart and professional woman. You\'ll learn a lot if you will be in class"
Great Prof. Seems like nice person too!
"I actually enjoyed this class. The professor was always doing whatever he could to help the students. when answering questions he can get really wordy, so he can seem not very direct. besides being wordy I thought he was a great teacher. He does do clicker exercises almost every morning which I didn\'t like however. podcasts! always a plus!"
"He is a very, very boring professor, but he occasionally does or says things that surprises you and makes you listen. Very easy grader. If you want a class where you are challenged and learn a lot, don\'t take this class. If you want an easy A, by all means, take his class."
Best Pofessor ever! She\'s funny and uses humour as a way to make the information stick! She is able to be funny while remaining professional. I highly reccomend her! She is also very helpful and always open to questions and appointments if extra help is needed! A+ Prof!
This is one of my least favorite classes. The teacher just goes on and on with stories and the lectures are pretty much pointless. I get more doing notecards during the lectures than I do from taking notes. Almost everything is based on the book that has fifty page block text for the chapters which isn\'t easy to read or comprehend.
Lenore was a great help and she will really go out of her way to help her students....GREAT ADVOCATE!! and very approachable regardless of what you may hear.
HE IS A GREAT TEACHER VERY VERY GOOD :)
Very knowledgable and easy to learn from. Cares about his students. Gives good advice. Would take Dr. Carpenter for another class.
Tells you exactly what he expects and tells it how it is.
He is a really good teacher. He is very clear in explaining the material and also about what will be on the test. He is always available to help and his study sessions before the tests are VERY HELPFUL. This class is not extremely easy but it also not impossible.
she is the best. I learned so much in her class that will make me be a better social worker. She is a fair grader. She cares about her students. Take her class
"I had tungas syg2010 online class. overall it was very easy, just do the discussion question each week which are all actually pretty interesting. He gives you a study guide for each test which is exactly the same as the test. He is nice and responds to emails quickly. I would recommend him to anyone"
"One of the best professors I\'ve ever taken a class with. This was not a walk in the park, as the class was really really challenging and demanding, but it was so worth it. he is an awesome teacher who pushed us to our limits, but this is an Indian law class so it goes with the territory. I really feel ready to go to law school. Make him full time."
"McIntosh doesn\'t explain concepts very well. I found him very confusing, and I thought he made things harder than they had to be. He does give online quizze, but his tests come straight from the discussions and problems worked in class. Only study in the book the concepts he mentions in class! Overall, this was a hard class, even for an A student."
Awful! I am an A-B student and I swear he gave me a D or an F on everything! It is almost like he doesn\'t want you to do well or suceed! I would not reccomend him as a professor.
"Nice teacher. Really wants to help you learn how to type. She talks a lot. She says it\'s to give you hands a break. Take her class, very easy."
Not the easiest teacher I\'ve had but not the most difficult either. He\'s a good teacher who knows what he\'s talking about. A friendly easy-going kind of guy.
"Professor Hennesy is great. She is understanding, funny, and very helpful. Be prepared to work. There are 2 papers, a presentation, a midterm, a final, and quizzes. If youre not affraid to earn your education take this class."
"Prof. Ensslin is hands down Amazing!! I learned so much from his class. Colleges need more people like him! He really does take it to the next level, takes time with you, makes the work so much fun! Take him!! You\'d do yourself a favor.I took his online course, and learned more than my campus classes! He even met everyone one by one."
"Doesn\'t really explain things well, makes it too complicated. Often shoots from the hip when explaining concepts (like why excess liquidity set the stage for the financial crisis) and gets it wrong. Exams are fairly easy though."
"Amazing professor! She brings in so much of her interesting life experience to the class. She also put up all of her notes on blackboard, so if you couldn\'t make it to class, it wasn\'t a big deal."
He is the best professor ever!
"Professor Karns taught a laid back but informational CAS101. She brought candy every class and was always lighthearted. It was a casual class and I learned some things, but definitely a good pick for this requirement."
"I learned so much in each of the three classes I took from Gezari, and I enjoyed the material in all of them."
"His lectures are a little boring, but overall he is straightforward and a good professor."
"If you want to learn but not sleep through classes, this is the professor to take! You\'ll need to work hard to pass this class, but will benefit you in the future."
great class Prof Christie really knows his stuff. He\'s very helpful easy to talk to and funny I really enjoy this class. Hope he teaches more Islamic courses at UBC. this is a must for anyone interested in middle eastern history from an Islamic angle.
"Wonderful teacher and human being. Cares for her students. Not the easiest to understand, she lectures with an interrogatory inflection. Very postmodern, pro-feminist, pro-minority, yet she doesn\'t mind if you have a different background. Very encouraging and supportive, as long as you do the reading and think critically. Very open-minded."
This is an online class so expect to do and learn everything by yourself. MIS 2 is the most difficult out of them so you should study really hard for that before you take the exam. MIS 1 & 3 are simple and easy to follow. I never needed help on these but whenever I had a general question about the class she\'d just tell me to refer to the syllabus.
He is the best teacher I have had so far. Very helpful and understanding. I really enjoyed in his class a lot. His tests are base on text books. Great teacher and makes the speech process a wonderful experience. I have told all my friends to take him as a speech teacher!
"This is a very boring class! Very long dry lectures! A lot of reading and note taking! Very strict professor! I would avoid taking his class. I failed it, because there was a 2 part final exam and I did not take the second part which was a 2 page essay. I did not like this class at all and don\'t take it if you don\'t have too."
If you are a marketing or maybe even management major do not take this guy at all cost. but if are not take him if he is available asap. You literally do not have to do anything in class and you get a 90% everything is given to you for a grade you do not even have to do the projects or assignments it\'s ridiculous.
"Great teacher! Very relaxed but loves what he teaches. Jokes are always thrown into the lectures to keep your interest. Homework is simple, no exams, attendance not taken but why skip?"
"Good prof, does a good job explaining concepts. Very chilling prof too."
"He makes a four hour science class AMAZING! There\'s no textbook, and a TON of museum field trips! Highlight of my week!!"
"yes his lectures are boring and u have to read a 900 page book. he knows whats hes talking about and he seems like he doesnt care about his students, but he really does. go to his office and he will help u with anything and practically give u the answers for the quizzes. i sat in his office for 2 hours and because of it i will now be his class."
"Dr. Smith\'s Contemporary Moral Problems class is one of the best classes I\'ve ever taken. Incredibly interesting lectures, and the tests are not difficult at all if you pay attention and take notes in class. Dr. Smith is super nice and cares about her students as well. Would recommend this class to anyone!"
He is cool. Just go to class and do a little homework. He is very helpful if you have questions.
"He is really not a great teacher. He doesn\'t teach you, he said not to get the book but I should have because I\'m pretty much teaching myself. He doesn\'t give a test review for tests. Very confusing if you don\'t know about politics & you have to participate its 20% of your grade. & he doesn\'t give extra credit. Don\'t waste your time on him."
AMAZING
"Statistics do not come easy to me, but this professor gave me all the help I needed, encouraged me, and never made me feel stupid."
No personality and ruthless when it comes to marking. Difficult course made even more difficult by a terrible teacher. You\'re given no room for error time wise on the midterms or the final. You have to write everything as fast as you can or else you won\'t finish.
"Mostly participation points, but tests were totally from reading. There were pretty much no lectures at all and you were pretty much supposed to just learn from the book. She\'s very little help, though rather amusing most of the time. Agree that she can just change moods in the blink of an eye. Overall a joke class. Easy A."
"She was pretty cool. Said the first day of class she\'d never correct your grammar out loud (but obviously on paper). She also said no essays; liar, liar, pants on fire! We had 3 in class papers to write and the final exam is essays. Overall easy class, except for her tough grading on the papers. The almost daily quizzes were also a little tough."
"he is a funny teacher that likes to talk about his kids, beer, and rifles."
"He\'s really strange but not too hard. No regular tests. Mid-term, final, research paper, and a few quizes. He\'s not too bad, but his class isn\'t really interesting at all. Be expected to talk about what you read every class"
Material was not covered in the appropriate amount of time. When asked to speak separately due to concerns about my grade Paradise printed my entire course load at SUNY Orange that dates back to 2008 to present. Paradise was not at all helpfully when asked for extra help and instead made me feel stupid. Would not recommend.
"all he talks about is the bible basically. this is not what i signed up for. if you\'re looking for a historical fiction class, this is the class for you! but like most people, i just want to get my enlish 102 credit out of the way. he assigns so much work that it\'s nearly impossible to keep up with other classes, on top of going to work."
"For those who don\'t think she\'s a tough grader, you are wrong. My classes average right now is a 68% and everyone failed the midterm. Extremely picky with your writing skills and looks for the nitty gritty details most teachers wouldn\'t."
"Make sure that if you have him for lab that you pay attention. He will not answer any of the questions you have unless you know the topic somewhat. He also lectures for a long time before lab even starts, so that is a waste of time. He is a tough grader for the lab reports and assignments, so make sure to have everything that is required!"
"Leigh is an awesome prof!She is very knowledgable and intelligent. Her texts can be long but are not too bad -- mostly gothic fiction. She is very helpful to go to during her office hours! Hard marker but use those office hours for feedback! Highly recommended! And she\'s not boring at all either, class discussion for half the class every day :)"
"Dr. Hayden was fantastic. She took what could have been really heated issues and brought it down to a personal level that makes you care. The second half of the semester was pretty hard, but she gives a lot of quizzes (you only have to keep the top 10 or so) so you can keep a good point total going. I would definitely recommend her to a friend."
Best Speech Teacher Ever. Only had to write 2 formal speeches. Fun Class. Highly recommended.
Easy class you just watch films every class. Easy assignments. Black Documentary class was kind of boring but yet still easy. I took her for 3 classes got A\'s on all 3. Hip Hop in films class was interesting I think after taking this course you will see how easy her classes are. Midterm and Final are essays with a couple of fill in the blank ques
Overall good teacher. Answers questions well and is very easy to talk to.
Dr. Martin is by far my favorite professor here at St. Eds. She really cares about her students and really helped me out when I decided to change my major. I met with her in her office hours and she was incredibly helpful and gave me great advice. She has such a fun interactive way of teaching and I loved her Child Development class so much!
I think Dr. Alexander is one of the clearest professors I\'ve ever had. She is very clear with what she wants from you and cares a lot about her students success. She often pauses during the lecture to clear up any misunderstandings and she has candy in her office hours. She is one the best professors I\'ve ever had on this campus.
what a frickin jerk! cannot teach worth kangaroo crap
We literally watched movies every single class. He really helped me and was super relateable and hilarious. Class is easy if you pay attention. I did not read once for the class and got an A.
"Really dope teacher, really helpful, got an A. He is one of the best teachers i have had at OCC, he is down to earth and young, he is like one of the students. Real funny guy, knows what he is talking about and very laid back, couldnt ask for more. Go Mr. Lee"
She was accessible outside of class. She gave really detailed feedback. Her lectures were organized and easy to follow. Course load was manageable.
"irrelevant projects, lack of specific instruction, droning on and on about inane subjects unrelated to advertising design. Nice guy, but not a great professor."
"She is a crazy woman and definitely energetic. Her lectures are boring because she reads straight from the powerpoints and isn\'t very clear. However, the tests and Wiley Plus are fairly easy and I ended up with an A in the course and I never paid attention."
"Great teacher really cares about her students, And goes above and beyond to help her students thrive"
She is very passionate about math. Super organized
"Great Teacher. Knows his stuff. Just study,do all your exercises and everything will be fine."
"I took him all my eet courses . His courses are hybrid; partial class and partial online. He provides video lectures, easy to understand and his tests are homework. do the labs and you get an a A."
I liked her teaching style and she made the subject matter simple yet interesting. I wish she taught psychology so I could have her again :p
good prof.. very smart and helpful
Yes...she is very HOT...which makes it easy to be in her class.....Do what she asks and you will have no problem.
"Stay away from this professor, marks down for having creativity and user preference. Even if program works still marks you down on the source code. -10 points if you\'re late by 2 minutes for any reason. Doesn\'t help on forums and doesn\'t really teach the class just reads from the powerpoint. Stay away from this guy he should be fired"
"Great professor! Do your work and you will do great in this class. She is younger so she understands students better and is funny. Great class, VERY EASY!"
"You need to be in class. alot of the questions on his tests are from what he says in class. It is open book, but you need to read the book to understand everything. He is hard, but he makes you think."
"Annie is young, fun, and very helpful. Definitely recommend taking this course with her!"
"I really have nothing bad to say. I enjoyed her class, she has a great teaching style and is not dull. She cares for her students and if you need the help, she\'ll give it. Basically, if you fail its your own fault.just do the work and the readings and you\'ll be be fine. Pay attention and seem interested."
He is very mean. The wording on his tests are very unclear. Often more than one right answer to a question. Not fair.
"Wonderful, insightful, intelligent, a wonderful teacher. I learned a lot."
"Dr. Soysa is very smart and is a great professor. This was a winter session course, so it was a pretty intense class. Dr. Soysa was very clear on her expectations and communicated regularly with her students."
"I took the online course with him and as of right now i want to know the living **** out of him, he irritates me, he gives you bull**** quizes that i know for certain have more than one ansewer yet you can only choose one, their to vague, and he scrutinezes the hell out of the writing assignments, a teacher is supposes to give help not bellitle you"
"Very good teacher, with lots of real world experience! Lots of homework, but you can use that on tests, which is extremely helpful if you take good notes. Attendance is mandatory, however, her lectures are interesting and she uses a lot of great real life examples."
"First off this guy knows his stuff probably one of the smartest professors I\'ve had at SCSU. Prepare to study around 10 hours per test if you want a decent grade. The paper he assigns also requires an extensive amount of out side class time around 15-20 hours. Overall, I enjoyed his class and would take again you will learn a lot."
"LAURA IS AMAZING. Never takes attendance but makes every class worth attending with lecture notes much more useful than the book, answering homework questions, and in class group assignments. Exams are like the quizzes and quizzes are like the homework. Calculus is a tough class but she makes it very doable; would not have survived without her."
"Great Teacher. The only way to fail this class is if you\'re lazy or too busy to focus in school. Mandatory is necessary, but classtime is never boring. Time goes by fast and he cracks a lot of sarcastic jokes. Very helpful, would recommend!!"
"I will never take her class again, she will not help you with your problems, she is a lazy teacher, and she gives tough grades, not easy to pass. She isn\'t a good teacher for LART 211, so DO NOT TAKE HER CLASSES!!!"
"I took professor Haj online for college algebra class. He is so knowledgeable and respectful. He cares about his students. Responds to emails so fast. Class was based on Pearson my math lab. 5 tests and he drops the lowest grade. A lot of homework but it has unlimited trying, so you could make 100 on the homework. Highly recommended."
He is hard to understand but once you start to understand him you do fine. His teaching style is good just needs to have a study session before each exam.
"He\'s very easy to talk to, funny, and very easy. Be prepared for lots of corny jokes, though!"
Dont not take her. most confusing teacher ever!She changes assignments on a whim if she thinks you are not paying attention.The class wasnt hard but the unexpectedness of it made it.Besides all that just trust me save the headache.
Professor is really good.
"Easy. She practically gives you the answers to quizzes on Fridays. There\'s one group assignment and 1 research paper (3-5 pgs)If you attend her class regularly you will pass this class with flying colors. Finals are easy since she posts practices quizzes online (which appear on the final as well. You learn allot in this class, don\'t miss out!"
I would have rather written papers than read stories!!
"She is an awesome professor. She will challenge you to do your best work, but you will be greatful in the end. Highly recommended."
"Anne is one of the best people at TRU. Not only does she really know her material, but is willing to always be there for her students and help them succeed. Her tests are fair and reflect the learning material and she always gives valuable feedback on assignments! Definitely a good choice for a positive experience at TRU!"
"I took MAN 2021 online. Dr. McPherson is really a nice teacher, She used the book. Do 5 discussions and 6 Case, Midterm and final test. This class is an easy A, as long you understand what she is asking. Very picky and does give feedback, read every chapter... In order for you to pass the test, Those are really hard, is made by her.."
"Robert ""Bobby"" Yi is an advisor for the Art Department who also taught my New Major class. His class was a blast. He encouraged participation, we watched videos, took campus tours, participated in group critiques, and more. There was a decent amount of homework but it was not difficult. He always gives great feedback and advice as well."
"Arscott focuses on skills you will need when you try to get a job in the film industry. He covers everything, from recording sound to being a grip to camera maintenance, and some of the more ""glamorous"" aspects as well, such as acting & directing. His classes are probably the most practical in any university anywhere. Be prepared to learn a lot!"
"Great Teacher, knows her stuff. Class is all in Sign Language so that aspect can be hard at times. She has a good sense of humor and we laugh as a class, but know when to be serious."
"i got a 9 on my first test, sarcastically i asked, oh this must be out of 10 right? he said no, 100, i was like well in that case i better get out now while i can, at least 5 people followed me..."
"omggg he\'s been reading the same damn passages from the same damn books for like the past thirty years. liven up man!!!no one would show up to class cuz there was nothing to be interested in. he\'s a very nice man, but his teaching methods suck."
She is understanding- be sure to get on her good side. Participate in class. She grades fairly and gives good reasons for what she took off. A little impersonal in class but great one on one. Recommend- you will defiantly write better and learn a lot to apply else where.
"This class is brutal for those with very little prior programming experience. You will fall on your face a lot while you try to navigate the book and materials (which can be very dry). Prof. Mathews is helpful but as the semesters moves along, get ready to invest in going to the comp. lab for more support. Take this class on-campus if you can."
"I liked her as a teacher, but I can understand where everyone is coming from. She definitely does pick favorites, and if you aren\'t one of then then you will struggle in her class, bad. She also is moody so you have to approach her at a good time."
Dr. Gunninson is a little awkward but she really cares about her students. She is always there for you and a very fair grader.
Dr. Walcott\'s class is really easy. All the tests are multiple choice and his lectures are usually interesting and easy to understand. I absolutely loved his class!!
I am thankful that I came across Mr. SCHAPIRO he\'s an amazing math teacher. As long as you have the will to learn you\'ll do just fine!
Doesn\'t give enough examples that are as hard as the quiz questions. And why no solution guide? Just numerical answers in text.
He\'s tough but if you show true interest in the material and actually try he will be very helpful. I took 4 or 5 of his classes as an MIS major and had to work but got the grades.
He is so passionate about history! Knows every detail about everything. If you like history and don\'t mind lots of note taking I can honestly say he is just about the best teacher I have ever had
"I honestly have never had a worse experience with a teacher, online orin person. All the things said by purveyoprevious students is true. She was VERY demeaning to the students, for no reason except that she was annoyed with our stupidity. That was clear. Many people ddropped out. She graded everthing the day before the class was done."
"Worst teacher, blames us for a test average of 56% without a 2nd doubt that it may be his fault for including materiel that only got covered AFTER the test. his own words (This is the first time I talk about this topic) yet we seen it on the previews test. I hope he stops teaching."
"classes are hard, tests are very hard!!! dr. borsch is a super nice guy and tries to help his students alot. Labs are easy, but the practicals can be hard. Keep up and STUDY for these classes!!"
"Absolutely terrible class. Impossible to understand the material in class, the TAs explain it much better than he does. He thinks he\'s teaching a grad course with 300 kids that love business stats and have been in the working world like him for 50 yrs. This class made me really question finishing my business class."
"He\'s a real nice teacher who really wants his students to pass. He gives an A for effort. As long as you show up to do the labs and do the homework, he gives you a passing grade. He\'s also lenient on turning in late work. He drops the lowest test score as well. He is passionate and you will not be bored during his lecture. Sometimes uses tangents."
What a wonderful person! She has guided me throught the last three years with professionalism and individual care. She is a true friend and would do anything for her students. A TRUE artist who shares her knowledge and abilities with her students in a most unselfish way!
DO NOT TAKE SPANISH 120 with Emily Springs. Nothing personal against the lady but this class was extremely hard or no reason. There is about 20 hours of online hw that no one can understand. The class doesn\'t prepare you for the exams at all and she is always late to class. I got an A in 110 and I hope to just pass this class.STAY AWAY FROM HER !
"brian is amazing. he is clear, passionate, and helpful. i would recommend him to anyone! (especially future nursing students)"
"He is the professor who just read the content of textbook. He is teaching just for helping you prepare your tests in this class, rather than teaching for the knowledge. He is the worst professor I met in the applied math course. Just half students will attend the class. So boring."
"Herr Smith was great. I was very happy with the course. It wasn\'t too fast, and the material was fairly straight forward. He doesn\'t really form relationships with the students, but he learns everyone\'s name in a matter of days! He speaks mostly German, but it\'s simple and easy to understand. I would definitely take a class from him again."
"As hard as music theory was, I always looked forward to John\'s class. Make sure you pay very close attention or you will miss some of the funniest, cheesiest jokes you have ever heard! Especially great if there is somebody to egg him on..."
Very passionate about the material and her passion\'\'s pretty contagious. She really drills all the info in your head so you remember them long after the course officially ends. Consequently her tests are pretty easy just pay attention in class. Papers are tougher but you can tell she\'\'s on your side and wants you to do well. A very great prof
This course was self taught. Expectations were not clear and only through asking for help from students that had already been in the class was I able to make sense of the assignments.
"Reggie is a smart man, but will simply lead you in circles if you ask for help, with his patented Hint 11 (try something else). He won\'t lead you in the right direction, and in Calc 2, that is a horrid trait to have. On quizzes, there are at least 4-5 problems in ONE SECTION"
"She graded the papers for theatre 15, and she was way too tough, it\'s just theatre class not a English class give me a break. She\'s a film major from STANFORD, enough said for us JC students."
She is the devil in disguise.
"The great Koranic scholar, said to be a bit chronic, the fuzz man, good doctor"
"First off...no idea how he still works. I never hear anything good, only thing that comes close is ""him...yea...he is a \'special\' kinda person"". His reviews you could turn around and give to him about his teaching. ""I don\'t like it"", ""you could do a lot better"". a lot being an understatement. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!"
Mean professor
"I honestly don\'t understand what he is saying! He is mumbling, almost like talking with himself and his accent throws me off...."
This class was the most interesting I have had at Oakland University. It was informative on the subject and a lifetime experience traveling and meeting with businesses. There was not pointless busy-work involved either.
"Not the most effective prof I\'ve ever had, but I think this has to do with inexperience. He is very inconsistent with marking, and at first I had no idea what he wanted on essays. Hint: be as ""to the point"" and brief as possible on essays. When I started doing this, my mark improved. He knows his stuff and is a very calm prof, but lacks experience"
"Great professor. He is able to give interesting lectures. His tests are a bit difficult if you don\'t understand the material, but he is quite clear when teaching. Will give homework due weekly that can help you study for tests. Don\'t wait till the last minute to study. Would take any class with him again!"
"MUST get the big picture in this class more than the obscure details. Exam takes full 8 hrs. Overall, engaging class and professor."
This class is applicable to real world application and Prof Pierce made this class enjoyable. She uses humor appropriately and can be a tough grader but she provides quality feedback.
"Decided to give us 4 weeks of backlogged homework and quizzes in the last week of class. Seems to use test bank questions, none of which are covered in the lectures. Midterm was too long and 90% of the class was still working when we had 10 min left. He doesn\'t respond to emails, covers maybe 30% of test material. Second worst professor I\'ve had."
Very friendly and very passionate about nursing. She wants everyone to succeed. She is also very understanding. Would recommend!
"This class was good, I learned a lot even though I took it online. There are a total of 9 Discussions with links. 8 Course Learning Outlooks. 4 Exams + Final. and he does give out an Extra Credit assignment. He is very generous while grading and gives feedback. :)"
He prepares you for the exam the class period before. Exams are very easy and there\'s one paper. However you don\'t learn about art. He tells stories about his past high school and college life and is very inappropriate and offensive. Also 3 absences and then a whole letter grade is deducted. I would advise taking a different class if not required
"Fantastic teacher! Very approachable and funny, did an excellent job of relating the material and making class interesting. Class gives you new perspective on a wide range of topics. Taking this class is the best way to get rid of your social analysis req, I would recommend this class to anyone."
I LOVE THIS MAN! HE IS FABULOUS! he is passsionate about what he teaches. He is a fun guy and always includes everyone. Take his classes! They are worth it!
I didn\'t really believe the other crits here but they are all true - taking a course with J-E has to be a life changing experience.
Poorly run class. I have never experienced anything this freak\'n boring.
She canceled many classes and was not very good at grading assignments fast enough. Very fair grader though.
"has favorites, is rude."
"Prof. Mayzlin what a hottie! so yea you can\'t understand him. i don\'t think he can even understand himself. his class is so easy. but don\'t expect to learn anything. it\'s easy because he solves the homework on the board, and the quizes are problems from the homework. BE AWARE OF THE FINAL he doesnt make it. the math dept does! screwed us all."
"Very approachable professor. Research Methods includes a big group project where you write a lit review and it takes the whole semester to complete. Makes you work hard and pushes you, but she knows that people can do it. If you need any help, she gives really good feedback. Always allows you to submit work for feedback before its due for a grade!"
"Best professor in my six years of school. After working as a science teacher in an urban school district for 10 years, I feel Dr. Borgerding was the one who really prepared me for the real world of teaching. She\'s so knowledgeable in her field and so so helpful! Be grateful you got this professor, there is absolutely no one else like her!"
He is a great teacher. Sometimes confusing but if the class looks confused he\'ll take the time to clarify. I really enjoyed the class. For me he brought some laughs to a boring subject.
She is the best teacher. She helps in any kind situation.
"Attendance isn\'t mandatory but if you don\'t come you miss a lot of good information that isn\'t on the slides. He gives test reviews a week in advance and tests are essay based with some multiple choice, but he gives the essay questions on the review so prepare ahead of time and you\'ll be good."
HE\'s awesomee!! you take him you will love him.. he\'s a funny guy very nice!! the tests come rite off the quizes that you have every thursday. you need the book to do your project but you will never have to read to study for a test.. like i said rite off the quizes and the slides! take himmmm
The professors ego makes it difficult to have a constructive. Does not hesitate to critique students work situation as an explanation to why you do not understand the material instead of explaining it when reaching out to him. I wish I had read rate my professor before taking this class.
The most horrible proffesor at CCBC!!!!
"Shows interest in student learning the programming language. Demonstrated how to compile and what was expected. Would consider him a super geek, enjoys his work, enjoys teaching. Displays the ability to communicate material to the non computer geek. I would hope that he teaches other classes."
"This course is a good GPA padder for someone who is widely read and who possesses a good vocabulary. Ms. Withrow is kind and helpful, and the lessons are a good review on basic spelling and vocab rules."
"I took Kamp for my tutorial. She\'s very nice and her discussions/readings were interesting- the discussion itself was easy enough that it\'s okay if you skip the reading now and again. Be warned, though, as she is REALLY nitpicky on essays and expects extensive editing on subsequent drafts of papers."
One of the best instructors I have ever had. Will help you with anything even if it isn\'t class related and is also very good at explaining what you need to do in an easy to understand way. He is awesome and got me writing even when it is not for school purposes.
"Simply put, ROD IS THE BEST PROFESSOR I HAVE EVER HAD. He genuinely cares for his students and explains everything very clear until every student gets a crystal clear idea of the concept. Keep up the amazing teaching rod!"
"Hard class, he\'s a stickler for grammer and the class really isn\'t that interesting but you have to take it. take it in London for lots of fun"
"I\'m currently taking this course online. Very difficult teacher. For someone who has never written an essay in their life, you will find this class quite difficult. It\'s definitely a huge work load. You will spend a majority of your time working on this class. Will I take another one of his classes? Most likely NOT!"
Guy is a jerk. I call because i was wanting to see what i got wrong on my quizzes so i would be able to study the correct things and he said dont worry about what you got wrong just move on and study for the exam and i tried telling him thats what i need the correct answers for and he said no still... Complete jerk off.
Great Teacher! Hard class but she made it very easy to understand.
"Overall it is a fun class and the topics are interesting. She seemed to be a nice professor at first but deffinetly is a little snobby to certain people. Lost lots of respect for her for that. Im a guy and enjoy the class, most people will enjoy. easy B, Fairly easy A."
"Ranked #9 in the world now, and deservedly so. Love J and L! Best and most woke profs EVER, and the best definition of what the LV experience is/should be."
Super nice lady who really knows her stuff. The class is extremely hard and she is a tough grader hen it comes to papers. My only suggestion is to use the \'coloring textbook\' even though it is not mandatory. It definitely helps when it comes to diagrams!
"He is really nice. Gave frequent, personalized, positive criticism. That is why I found him very helpful. He is very engaged with his students, learns your names and helps everyone individually which is almost unheard of. One of the rare ones. Highly recommended."
"This teacher is great! the only issue that ppl have w/ him is that he makes you think, he wont just give the answer to you.u have to STUDY, gettin in a study group makes it better, but the tests are difficult, ONLY if u dont know the material well.He\'s willing to help anyone as long as ur willing to help yourself.his sense of humor is off the wall!"
"Online option of this course is terrible. She does not update grades until the very end of the year, so you dont know how you ever did on projects throughout the semester. Also all of her assignments are from the 90s.... she expects a lot but puts in no effort herself. Is hard to talk to and thinks she is better than everyone. And always right."
"Teacher was a sweet lady. Does expect you to show up to class regularly. Has a print out of every test and what to expect to be on it, and follows it. If you pay attention to her in class you can make a decent grade with note writing and studying the night before. I made a B without much effort. She will help you if needed and you talk to her."
"DR. Bedore is simply the best teacher at NOVA. She is easy, very helpful, very nice, and a great person. she makes class fun and tells stories. loved her class. Must take!"
Not a very good teacher. Not very clear at explaining things and very dull when it comes to lectures. I would suggest finding someone else for speech.
"AVOID PROFESSOR AT ALL COST. He is not clear in expectaions. VERY DIFFICULT grader. Lectures r EXTREMEMLY boring. He reads to u frm text. I\'m an A student & had to struggle to stay interested. Homework due ech meeting, but only collects some of class. Scanton tests on dates, names, useless facts. 3 papers - 2 pgs & can only site frm text."
gives lots of work and floods your email inbox. he needs to find something to do other than harass his students 24-7.
Jeff is awesome. his class is fun and he brings a lot of real life experiences to the class room.
"He took a little while to get used to. He makes all his classes kind of sexual, and his politics come out a little too much sometimes, but it\'s ok. He is very helpful and knowledgeable, and most of his lectures are great. Not hard at all. If you fail you\'re lazy or stupid."
He\'s old-school from Scotland. Very strict classroom environment. Also very witty. I wish he taught all my classes.
"Marasco is the best organic professor ever! He is very clear about what he expects from you, and his tests are not difficult. He makes a lot of jokes during lecture as well, and although he repeats them often, they\'re still adorable. I wish he was teaching 202..."
"VERY UNCLEAR. If you ask a question, she won\'t answer and will tell you to slow down and that you\'re over thinking it. I never enjoyed this class once with her, although it is an easy class."
"There could have been a streaker in the back of the room & she would never have noticed because she never looked @ us. In terms of the class its self, it was very easy. I ended up with 120% (A+) and I\'m typically a C student. Her personality was ok. I found her to be helpful & seemed to care about her students. Eye thing aside, shes not too bad"
Wonderful Professor !!
"I can\'t blame her too much for ignoring me in class; it\'s an intro class with a standard outline and material to go over, but it was pretty annoying to have her interrupt and move on due to time constraints."
"TRES HORRIBLE!! Plays favorites and doesn\'t talk about relevent things in class. The stuff on the test comes out of nowhere, and she has no mercy with her boring voice, won\'t hesitate to fail you even though most of the problems were because of her unability to teach."
"Mr Huff is a great teacher, very easy to get an A in this class. Show up and do the work and you will be fine."
"Took a 50 minute class M,W,F and all he did was lecture but overall he was a great teacher! I learned so much about AST and i would definitely take his class again."
He is very knowledgeable for his subjects but his short answer questions can kill u on the exam. I personally think it is reasonable for him to get angry for students coming to his class late. It\'s a common sense.
"Ege\'s lectures are good, and he is good at explaining concepts. However, he is not much help over email, especially when you can\'t figure out an error. I relied on friends, stackoverflow, and even other profs instead. Expect enthusiasm and explanations, but not much coding help."
"She told us to ""discuss"" and just sat there for the rest of class, even through the long awkward silences. She\'s the reason I\'m no longer an English major."
"owesome instructor, he cleared every thing about anatomy and gave me courage."
"She was so great! I bit of a hard marker when it comes to written assignments but other than that this was my favorite class this semester. (Also, the midterm was pretty easy if you went to class.) I would definitively recommend her classes."
she knowsn her stuff very well
Really tough assignment!!
good teacher very friendly. gives some extra credit not much. makes you feel a little dumb when you ask questions but eventaully answers it so you understand whats going on. i recommend takin her for lab and lecture at the same time lab is really easy just show up i failed every quiz in lab except for like 2 and got an A in the class. easy teacher
"he\'s not a terrible professor, just study the powerpoints for the exams. his exams aren\'t easy to do well in and the class is tough. but he does iClicker quizzes and that does help your grade alittle bit. he\'s also really funny though and that helps keep the class going."
"What a complete waste of my time. He obviously has passion for the topic, but had no idea how to focus the class. No point in going to lecture. Ridiculously overcomplicated,and way too detailed for a gen ed. He did give us Girl Scout cookies though, and I think he might have picked up his uber fail when about 10/60 people showed up to class daily."
"She tells you exactly what she wants, so you can\'t complain about your grades. Great teacher, knows what shes teaching and what she wants from you."
"I took her online and disliked it a lot!!!she doesn\'t answer her emails and doesn\'t tell u if u r doing well on the discussion board. Test are simple, some are from the slide shows others I do not knw where she got them. Then again I never read for this class."
One of my favorite professors. She is so nice and helpful and will not stop until everyone understands the material. Take her when you can
"He has no teaching ability. He had to make attendance severely effect your grade or no one would show up to class. In class he is not worried about whether you understand the concept, he just writes out a proof and it almost seems like he takes joy in our confusion."
He\'s very helpful if you don\'t understand something. Don\'t be late and mistake his kindness for weakness
Great Teacher
"Dr. Matthews has unfair grading practices, is not helpful, does not respond to emails and failure to properly communicate with her students (she responds emotionally, opposed to taking into account the problems with communicating via email. Sometimes a message is sent, but just never received). I would not recommend her as a professor."
Very hard teacher. Does not have time to answer some homework questions. Feels that it is her responsibility to get the information out to the student...tuff luck if the student doesn\'t get it.*One good thing about her is that she gives great step by step notes for working problems. Not a fun class.
"This teacher is the worst teacher i have ever had. It\'s very unfortunate, due to the fact that I have had to take at least 4 classes with him, so far. He is a nice guy, and he\'s really smart, but he just can\'t communicate."
"Very helpful professor. Not alot of work for the class, just small papers about the reading, etc."
THIS was NOT an honors level course! No one in the class was ever sure what she was talking about or what was due. The syllabus is not worth anything! She is unhelpful and asks you to email her every class to remind her what she is supposed to be posting! She loses your work and then never emails you back and blames a full inbox. Drop her class!
"I found the class to be interesting, but the exams will kill you (I think it was mostly due to the textbook). Very nice prof though"
"She\'s very nice and care to her students. You have to ask her if you don\'t understand, she\'ll explain to you clearly. Her test\'s review is very helpful.She\'s funny!...and smart.."
"I had Ortiz for a couple of courses. She is very smart, but never talks down to students. She listens first to determine how to address a students question. Teaches right from the book and spoonfeeds those that need spoonfeeding. She was very kind, helpful and conscientious."
"I stopped going to lecture about 3 weeks into the semester. I made sure to get to the small group sessions, and get the homework done, and got a B. This guy has a huge ego and is super arrogant, and the few lectures I went to I just passed out in."
Easy to get an A. Need to pay a little attention in class. Great professor.
She is so helpful. Take her!! She is such a good teacher!! I would take her again!! Easiest A I have ever made!!!
"Dr. Goreham is by far my favorite professor. He will challenge you with subjects and assignments that will make you think for yourself and a little outside the box. He is somewhat of a tough grader, but will give you plenty of feedback to help you achieve your best grade. He enjoys teaching his courses, which makes learning more enjoyable."
Great Teacher. Very talented and creative
"Chris is awesome! You can tell that he\'s so passionate about archaeology (and anthro in general) and it made the class fun and interesting. He can be super vague about tests, but take notes to study and it\'s not hard. No text book & you don\'t need to do the BB readings. Can be hard if you don\'t have a basic understanding of anthro, but he\'s great!"
"In a department full of awesome professors, Gingerich is tops!"
"Online class is simple. 40% of grade is based on discussion board participation the rest is spread between 2 exams and 2 papers. Although it goes without saying, avoid this class if you dislike reading. Most of the books were very boring."
"hated this class. she is a horrible teacher and likes to do the same thing over and over again in class. she is the laziest teacher i have ever had so by the end of the semester you have 3-4 papers due in the last 2 weeks. she takes 3-4 weeks to grade papers which is annoying. overall, the class sucked because she doesn\'t know how to teach."
"I concur with other comments about Terry - lectures are quite mundane, lectures infrequently concluded with tangible relations to the world, and long hours spent on homework every week. Old-school professor with outdated habits. However, I can say I learned a great deal of heat transfer in his class, but in twice the time it should have taken."
"If you dont like poly sci, you probably wont like the class. if you do its really interesting and you learn alot, kind of boring at times but there were some good discussions and he says hilarious stuff on occasion. participation and attendance are 1/3 of the grade along with two papers."
"I would definitely take him again. His class has an average amount of work to it. The tests are done on your own time, and only a few assignments had actual due dates. I texted him one late evening with some concerns about a project, and he answered immediately and was very nice and very helpful and wants to see his students succeed."
"I don\'t think I would take this professor again. She gives four short multiple choice tests with mostly easy questions, but she always puts a few tricky ones in too. She takes attendance but it is absolutely pointless to be there as long as you have the review sheets. I just found it boring and more difficult than it should have been."
"If you are prepared to work, and don\'t expect everything to always be laid out neat and nice for you, she is an invaluable resource. This woman loves science and you will do things unheard of in a first year bio class, and learn more than you\'d ever expect."
"she is a smart and helpful teacher and hav a lot of quizs and homework. but its easy, if you do your homework. but there one thing. she is VERY BAD. if you absent to much she will drop you no matter what. EVEN that u have a GOOD grade. SO bad teacher (F)"
Very interesting lectures. You have to put in work to do well in this class. The material is not difficult. Apply yourself and you\'ll do just fine. 4 online quiz\'s and 3 100 question tests.
This was one of the most laid back teachers I have ever had but the class was very interesting. The tests were very easy and he told us exactly what material was going to be on them. Make sure to pay attention to the slides shown in class because those will definitely be on the tests. I would definitely recommend him to anyone taking an art class.
"Ms. Derousie was an awesome online instructor for med term.I took the class more or less for fun,but I found that she challenged me.She is very understanding,I had an accident half way through and she worked with me to allow me to get all my work submitted.study the lecture notes,all tests and quizzes come from them."
"Mollick is straight to the point. This is a composition course, so be ready to write. You get to choose what you write about, so pick something fun. Mid-term and final are blue book but simple and easy. She is a great professor and very nice."
Easy lab assignments and sometimes lets us go home early.
"I took prof. Selleck for Shakespeare II and I really reccomend her. Her quizzes are really easy, and so are her tests (as long as you go to class and pay attention). She\'s big on attendance, but her classes are pretty interesting, and as long as you participate once in a while you\'re pretty much set."
"Marcia was a great instructor when it came to this class. Instructions on how to complete all assignments were not extremely clear, but then again it was my first online course I took. After a while, I caught on. Easiness is average, especially if it\'s your first economics class. I would take her course again though if I had to. She was nice =)"
"very easy class, super easy papers, but he is weird as hell, feels like he\'s staring right through you when he talks, gets flustered when you sneeze. Easiest A I ever got. Says his spanish teacher from high school, called him a ""bueno chico""(in a really bad american pronunciation of the phrase), says this throughout the semsester. Definitely."
"clear, funny - not boring. but not like a ""wow - hes best at this, and best at teaching this"" either. might not exactly encourage you to independently, he kind of maps out what exactly u should be studying and how much. his structural method ends up making u learn if ur paying attention"
"The class can be overwhelming at first. Once you get a hang of it, it\'s ok. Lots of required stuff, but he gives good examples and a peer review. The test isn\'t as bad as everyone says. Just make sure you keep up on the readings."
Swim fitness is sooo fun! Marc totally rocks!! You should totally take his swimming classes if you are a fan of swimming or just want to stay in shape. He is really nice too and understanding :D TAKE HIM!!!
"His lectures are very boring, he teaches with nothing on Moodle and barely has notes up on the bored. His tests are 2/3 of what he says in class and 1/3 out of the book. I had a hard time paying attention to him because he was extremely boring. Advisor wasn\'t surprised when I dropped it, I was definitely not the first."
Look to be honest people like her because she is easy. But her class shouldn\'t be for college credit. If you like acting and want to be an actor never take her class because she will teach you nothing.
"Good teacher, but you will have to work hard just to get a B"
Dinkin is a great teacher. Her grading is fair and she has a great sense of humor. Very nice and willing to help her students at all time. Very clear on explaining her lectures.
Paula cares more about genuinely educating her students than most other professors in the department. I learned useful skills in her class.
"When trying to study for a test if you ask questions about the material he\'ll tell you that you are getting too close to an answer and won\'t help anymore. His questions are vague. His expectations are never clear until after the assignment. He wrote the texttextbook for the class himself, which is never a good sign. Don\'t take if you can avoid"
"She is definitely one of the greatest and funniest prof I\'ve ever had. She is a very sweet person also. Take her class, you won\'t regret!! :)"
"Annie is great! She loves what she teaches and makes it so easy for you to learn! No attendance but she gives extra credit in class if you go (I have a 116% right now) So easy, always done early and everything is online! I want more classes with her!!"
"Professor Bellovich is amazing at teaching trig! I have always struggled with learning trig, but she made it fun and easy, with the work I put in outside of class. I would definitely take from her again and can\'t say enough good things about her and her teaching!"
"boring, lectures optional, not approachable, wouldnt go out of my way to say hi. did to well in his class though. read the text it\'s all you need."
He was not very helpful. Study guides did help but usually did not relate to the tests.
GREAT TEACHER! she is really helpful and makes the material fun to learn!
worst class i do not recommend this class for anyone who has their life together She talks about bogus stuff the entire class it\'s easy enough though with ALL busy work that has no meaning. If you care about your watershed then this class is for you. If your looking for any form of education information NOT HERE. answers questions with questions!
"I took 1305 with Mrs. Thomas last fall looking back now I know that if I didnt have such a clear understanding of the things she covered in that class I would be failing all of my other classes. If you are looking for a solid understanding of programing logic and great foundation, you couldnt pick a better teacher."
"I just got my final grade back today and it is horrible. She is a horrible professor and she needs to re-evaluate her teaching skills. She knows her material, but she can\'t teach. Take my word and do not take her. I honestly put out 110% from reading the book on my own and barely passed with a point to spare me a C. Do Not Take Her!!! Rant Over."
Dan Shaw Has helped me in more ways than just journalism. He has the most humble attitude and makes it easier to learn.
cathie opie is great fun.
"Nick is possibly the best English teacher I ever had. He gives about 3 to 4 homework assignments per week but they aren\'t all that difficult, they\'re doable. He assigns about 4 essays throughout the semester, which he makes it as easy as possible to complete by turning in pieces of the essay at a time. All of his feedback is clear and helpful."
Great Professor. Really learn history with him take this class you will be glad you did. He beleives in doing meaningful work and not drudgery :) :)
Lots and lots of reading with just much confusing and tedious assignments. HARD grader but wants you to achieve full potential
"Not my favorite professor. The lessons take forever to start. We got the final paper less than 2 weeks before it was due and expected too much with such a short time. She is helpful outside the class. I wish I had taken a different course, I need to pass but I\'ll be lucky if I do."
"You don\'t formally analyze scripts, you just chit-chat about them. You dont learn much of anything, just write typical papers, and do insanely boring assignments, especially the library assignments. Just read the cliff-notes to everything, write the dumb papers, and do the stupid assignments and annoyingly strict bibliographies. Nothing interesting"
I love Professor Williams so far - his power points are full of info and his quizzes and exams are very reasonable.
"One of the best professors I\'ve ever had! Accounting is hard but he makes in manageable. There\'s a lot of homeworkand the system teaches it differently, but Hortensi is willing to help you and really cares for his students and if they understand the material and wants them to pass."
boring a waste of time the worst she doesnt really interact with the students she is just boring
"nice lady, but too many dumb assignments. difficult to get an A"
"Great professor. I felt her tests were a little too difficult and had questions that were a too specific about unnecessary things. However, I would recommend taking her. Knowledgable, friendly, and much more interested in the students then other professors."
"His lectures are clear and straight forward but a bit boring. I personally loved his classes but I find macroeconomics fascinating. For those who are not interested in economics, this class may be a bit of a turn off for you. Method of grading is also very straight forward, put in the time to understand the concepts and you\'ll do fine!"
"He is definitly not a easy grader. Overall, I think he\'s fine. Well, the only thing I feel uncomfortable about him is that he curses too much, even though it might be funny."
"Dr. Cherney, in addition to being the nicest prof on campus, is also very clear, fair, and interesting. Nothing but good things."
"She was a great teacher. I learned alot in this class.If you want to pass 1301, take her."
"The class is easy, but understanding what she is talking about-not so easy. She jumps around topics a lot so it is really hard to follow the notes she has you write. None of my notes were helpful at all. She grades papers pretty stiff and the class is a bore but she is a very nice person."
"easy easy easy class. she\'s pretty dramatic, and the actual lecture time is pretty boring. but the assigned readings aren\'t that bad, and i\'m not a reader. quizzes are totally easy. definately an easy A or B. just read the stories and you\'ll have an A, no problem. she\'s kinda loopy though...she practically cry every class period."
"Professor Collins is very easy to understand. She will tell you exactly what she wants. Try not to miss classes, or you\'ll miss easy A assignments. Attendance and class participation is key. The tests don\'t seem to follow what\'s learned in class except for the essay portion and those aren\'t hard to attempt and receive full credit for."
Great teacher! Really encourages intelligent discussion!
"Lectures confusing and unclear--it\'s his first semester teaching ME1. However he works very hard in studying the material and puts a lot of effort to help students. Great professor, but ME1 is not his specialty. Class organization is poor and disjunct, but machining lab is very fun. Midterms are inconsistent and tricky to study for."
Teaches very well and trys to help you out (I recommend him)
"Teacher is\'nt very clear when lecturing in front of the class but If you read the textbook after class, Its verrry easy. All the quizzes are simple (multiple choice and true/false)."
"She was very committed as an instructor and answered questions timely. There was an unusual amount of homework ,though it was an online class... I was spending about 10 to 15 hours a week on coursework. Learned a lot. Online course was very organized. If you take her course be ready for a lot of challanging assignments."
All the chem classes he teaches the same. He makes you think outside the box and is very enthusiastic about chemistry. His office is a must to go to. HW is not required but highly recommended. He tells jokes and does a little shimmy when it is really funny. Take him especially if you are a Chem major.
"This teacher is cool, but he uses to many analogies when he is teaching. Therefore you learn nothing about what he is trying to explain or how it really works. His tests are pretty hard just because he does this trick question stuff. There is only about three hw assignments the whole semester. He is hard take someone else."
"Davis is a great teacher. He gives lectures based on his life experiences and gives only real world examples. There is little direction, but that is the point of learning and strategy. Get the text for his tests."
"He is a great thesis advisor. Very laid back with dry humor. He will help if you need it, but don\'t expect too much guidance if you don\'t seek it out."
"This class was an easy A-don\'t buy the book, I did not use it once and got an A. The tests are straight from the handouts that he passes out in class, and he does not count attendance against you so you can miss as many days as you want. He was very easy but you have to study to get an A- the test questions were tricky (only 2 tests and a paper)."
"I took Int. French II with Stella. It\'s clear that her first language is not English, but I thought understanding her was pretty easy. If you read and understand the lessons in the book you will be set. Make sure you study for the tests because there aren\'t many chances to bring up your grade. She grades easy and the workload is minimal. Recommend."
"Vilander is amazing. I have taken 3 of her classes for my art history major and if you are looking for a seminar to take, her photography one is awesome! very straightforward and easy, 2 short papers and you had to do short presentations on each, but she makes you very comfortable. I would even recommend her to non-ARTHI majors, you\'ll learn a lot."
"A very odd man, but not difficult. He just keeps going on and on about I don\'t know what. He recites poetry randomly and asks students random questions. He gives two papers as the only real assignments all semester. He is really euthastic about art. Once again he isn\'t a tough professor just really really really really ODD."
"Professor Hertz is hilarious. He made us do really strange activities, and said whatever he wanted all the time. You can tell he\'s very passionate about his work :)"
"Amazing professor, likes to hears everyones opinions so that you learn from each other and learn to respect others. The class is super interesting"
We love Laurenzi. He has a bad rep but none of its true. His assignments are difficult but doable and he\'s very helpful...plus he\'s sexy!
"heres a tip NEVER catch the flu, you\'ll regret it. Oh and NEVER take this teacher if u are nice looking( whether its physical or you are just VERY well kept.) It sounds mean, but it seems she only likes ugly people. Ive heard this from multiple people."
"Knowledgeable, pleasant, and intelligent enough but springs assignments without warning. Mentioning a 10-pp essay less than two weeks before its due date? Suddenly changing the due date and page length for the term paper? Does he know the word syllabus? He won\'t set guidelines then wonders why we struggle. Disorganized and stressful class."
"Raymond is hot in this really weird way. I\'m almost ashamed to say so. I enjoyed having him as a teacher. though I didn\'t learn a whole lot, it was interesting nonetheless"
"He is amazing. He will push you to become not only a better student but a better person. He encourages critical thinking, and treats each and every student like an adult. He is not only a genius, he is also hilarious."
Too many assignments and work for a beginners photography class. Teacher is nice.
"Dr Badua was a real piece of work. He comes off slightly rude and belittling at times, but he\'s just directly by the book. Make sure you\'re on time, because he locks the door, he gives 4 exams that are 30-35 mostly computational questions. There are oral quizzes, 2 HW assignments, and 3 SAP projects.. exam avg on half of grade... it\'s doable!"
"if you take this class thinking it\'s going to be an easy A.... it\'s not!!! She is very passionate about what she teaches but her tests are very difficult and you pretty much have to read the whole book to score a C on a test. If you are taking this to bump up your gpa like I thought, it won\'t help."
BLAH
Gives Bs just because you might in the future do better so he saves the As just in those cases a.k.a. no logic.
DO NOT TAKE! Worst teacher. Never prepared. Never on time. Reviews hardly reflect exams. Students NEED to teach themselves the material. She is not very professional and does not make time for her students! DO NOT PAY FOR THIS CLASS!
"Not going to lie, thought this class would be easy b/c it\'s not 281. Tests were actually fairly difficult. You will have to work very hard to break the curve b/c almost everyone gets a B+ and kids who took 281 take 282. Weekly assignments are annoying b/c you have to go to OH to get anything right. Prof is sooo boring, but prepares you for mcat"
The Best Teacher Science teacher i have had. Be a good student and get a good grade. She is so polite and willing to help. She really pours her heart into her teaching and I was really impressed with her character. She totally elevated my level of learning and interest in science.
"Great teacher. I did all the HW and went to see him when I was stuck. He worked the problems with me and showed me what I was doing wrong. So far, I have high grades on 3 exams. HW is easy since you can do it as many times as you want and get a 100! If I can do well on the last exam, the final is optional. Go to class, do the HW and you\'re OK"
"I guess one could say this professor is nice and all. However....what ever happened to coming to class on time and honoring your obligations of professor. I think he is highly unorganized, and his ways are forcing me and my class mates to learn a difficult subject from the book. He should do his job!!!!!!!!!!!"
"He knows his material well and makes it interesting by using good demonstrations and examples in class, but he expects you to read each long and boring chapter at least three times and makes quiz and test questions very specific and difficult."
"Amazing teacher, discussion-based classes, Learned a lot from him!"
She is an amazing teacher who is always looking for ways to help you succeed. She really wants you to do well but makes you work for it. She really understands if you are going through things and will help you work it out with course load. I didn\'t get a grade because it was pass/fail but I did pass.
"Gives too much work, thinks students only have her class and they can do all the work she gives, not helpful for COMPASS exam at the end of the class at ALL!!!Would not take her everr again!"
"HARD class...... the Access portion will kill you, but go see him for help, hes the nicest guy you\'ll find and definately cares about his students. If you dont understand something GO SEE HIM, hes always willing to help, or email him, he will answer the question for you. and if you go see him, he does ur project for you...."
"Ghedotti... What a saint! My favorite professor. He makes classes fun, he puts in effort to make sure that you understand the material, and he is very detailed in lecture and lab. His tests are straightforward and will be easy if you study. Make sure you memorize the definition of science that he gives you. Also, a great person to talk to anytime."
"Online 101A. Very easy class, not that time consuming, but extremely boring. Class was disorganized so it was hard to stay on top of quizzes, but had a regular schedule that was easy to keep up with. Worth taking for an easy A or B. I\'d recommend it unless you love English and want a dynamic class where you actually learn (then again Easy A!)"
"I loved this professor, I went to his office hours a couple times and was very very helpful highly recommend this professor. STUDY the notes he gives you in class, not the book."
He knows his subject. You don\'t have to use the book unless you can\'t listen to professor lectures. He gives us essays but they\'re simple.
"I was not a big fan of him for the first part of the term as he came off arrogant and rude, but as the term went on he got better. You must attend class as he supplements his slides. He\'ll basically tell you what slides you NEED to know for the exams, so focus on those ones. His exams are pretty fair, just make sure you study hard!"
She is my absolute favorite! Amazing!
"Prof. Ugalde is the best teacher ever. His class is awsome. U can learn a lot from him. Very understanding. Very knowledgeable professor.People who dont do good is because they are lazy. If u do your work u will do good, even though you desagree with him. I did and still got an A. It depends if u want to work for a good grade. Highly recomend him."
"Mrs. Graham is a great teacher, she does seem to be very busy and therefore may not dedicate as much attention to any one class that may need it."
She\'s the best. If you try and make an effort she will go out of her way to help you. The work isn\'t difficult but requires effort to complete. Ask her for help and expect to write A LOT.
"This man is a genius at math. Unfortunately, he cant teach very well. If you dont grasp the material well you are in trouble. Forgets little things occasionally. Always wears champion t-shirt (or sweatshirt if it is cold outside) and jeans. An overall nice guy though"
"Awesome, makes sure everyone is on the same page and understands the material thoroughly."
"He is very funny and overall a good teacher. Some people in my class couldn\'t pay attention, but it\'s probably because we sat in a dark autitorium with cushion seats. He offers extra credit just in case you slip up on a test. Take this class if you need a break from lectures and cold teachers."
"I had no interest what-so-ever in art when I entered this class. Mr. White is a boring man but the class is very easy. The only items that we were graded on were a test, paper, oral presentation, and then the final. Easy A."
"excellent intro to sociology, has great sense of humor and interesting lecturer"
i like him
"Amazing professor and class! Also, very easy to get an A (not a lot of effort). Keep up with the material (few pop quizzes; not hard), tests are easy, and you get to write a short film review (600 words only, very easy). His lectures were great since he makes them fun, lively, and interesting. He is also very funny and nice too. Highly recommend!"
Wow! She is not an does not know how to transfer knowledg. Worst prof by far I have ever had. All she does is read from lecture notes that someone else made up cause she knows nothing about the subject. I will and suggest that everyone avoide her class.
I think Prof. Patrik is an awesome professor. I really loved her course on Existentialism.
"The class was simple. Go to class, take notes, do the study guides, and you will pass the tests. Take her, you\'ll be glad you did."
"Be aware when taking this class, His gotomeeting session were claimed to be voluntary but points were given and participation was accessed in a project. No feedback on previous assignments and has not graded three of the 5 projects. Course tempo was a Project due tuesday, discussion board intial tuesday night, and two other discussion post by sun"
"His class revolves around reading and discussing studies and articles that are way above the level of an undergrad. Expects much more than the class can give him and doesn\'t explain anything clearly. No lecture notes to study from, the only thing you have is the articles that are provided to you. Goes off on random tangents in the middle of class."
"Very hilarious professor. However, Calculus II (Integral) is no laughing matter. Expect a lot of homework and make sure you can move fast on exams. A lot of effort to do well in this class! If you\'re unsure of anything, stop by and see him during his open-door office hours instead of crying because ""you didn\'t know"" (act like an adult)."
"Go to class for the orange text, took her section with Bonine and Walsh. She was the easiest of the 3 but did not teach much through the semester. study the powerpoints"
"Great Teacher. Show up for class, do homework, ask questions. I was not looking forward for English but Professor Snell made it fun and easy to undersand. Take her class. I would recommend it."
"I absolutely loved this class! Mexal is great. Funny, nice, and adorable. The class has a really good structure. He usually goes through one person\'s works each class, and it never feels too rushed. He gives out random quizzes so try to read everything. The exams are pretty hard so you really have to study. Overall this was my favorite class!"
"Lectures are useless. Your best bet is to bring your textbook in and take notes out of it during class. Assignments are easy but do not relate anything to midterm and final. The final was on questions we had never even gone over. Easy class until the final, you\'ve been warned"
"Threw the syllabus to the wind, the attendance grades and webassign grades ended up not mattering in the end just because he didn\'t feel like grading it. Should have received a B with all the homework and attendance but ended up getting a C. He also never did example problems and just showed powerpoint slides that were just pictures from the book"
Sister Gwilliams is awesome! This class will clarify so many math concepts that you need to know as a teacher. The class is pretty relaxed but we learn a ton. She\'s a hard grader and expects a lot but is flexible and super nice!
ew.
Bethany is pretty schnazy
He is not good at all and gets mad when you are not clear about something
"great prof, knows her stuff, wish she would put her outlines on blackboard though."
"Prof tr\xc3\xa8s dr\xc3\xb4le et dynamique! a garder absolument dans votre horaire! Il y a des powerpoint a tous les cours. Des fois il derape un peu de la mati\xc3\xa8re alors il faut bien faire ses lectures et faire le plus d\'exercice de cas pratique possible! en g\xc3\xa9nerale, tr\xc3\xa8s belle exp\xc3\xa9rience. J\' ai fini avec A + :)"
I understood most of what he was talking about. He has a really cocky attitude but for the most part he is an okay teacher. You get very little extra credit for the class and you must do well on the test to get a good grade in the class.
This teacher is not what i expected. She teaches by powerpoint and is not clear on the reviews. After every powerpoint she gives out test.With reviews but still hard and not clear. Requires: Concert Attendance and alot of effort. AVOID TAKING HER. She talks non stop.
"She doesnt prepare you for the tests...she tells students to shut-up and what not. When it is loud thats when she does all the work and she WONT repeat, I even sat in the front and she didnt accknowledge the students that were in the front paying attention...I also had her in HS. She was better teaching in HS."
TEACHER DOES NOT LET YOU TALK NOR HELP EACH OTHER IN CLASS. HE\'S KIND OF DULL IN HIS TEACHING STYLE. I GUESS HE\'S OK.
"Label a class ""PHI-020, intro to logic"" and you assume an introduction to the world of philosophy and logic, right? Instead, you get a geometry course where you\'re memorizing tens of rules and writing down tons of proofs. This should be labeled MATH-020. Not worth taking unless you have to."
"I have to disagree with some of the posts. Prof. Moyer was excellent!!! I hated algebra, and not that I like it any better now, I am able to understand it, thanks to her. She held a math lab for extra help and I thought she was very basic in her teaching methods. I had another prof. for this last fall and dropped it because she was awful!"
"Yes, it is true that she talks to you like a small child and such, and this class is very easy, test-wise, but you find that you do learn a lot from the class, and Dr. Romer is a very nice, albeit very eccentric professor."
very very cool guy
He was a great teacher. Just make sure your cell phone is turned off! He lets encourages you to dress up for halloween! He\'s the best
"I grew more as a writer in one semester with Ms. Hall than I\'d ever think possible. You will be a much better writer at the end of the semester than you were at the beginning. She is, in my opinion, the perfect professor. I never felt bored in her class, which is really saying something for someone with my attention span."
The class is boring anyway and she doesn\'t make it any better. I haven\'t taken a final yet but it\'s going to be hard in association with the project which has too many guidelines and too many ways to screw it up. I\'d avoid her class and take someone else.
"Mr. Morris is a great instructor. His personality is one to get used too. As long as you are willing to learn in his class, he is very eager to teach. He will not just give you answers. He has the intensity of Darth Vader, with the wisdom of Yoda. !"
yay!
"Cureton is a great professor. He can joke around with students, but when it comes down to the lectures he\'s serious. You MUST read to do well in this class. The readings are not long at all. He shows an overhead of the final...(hint hint) type it up while he has it there so throughout the semester you can refer back to it. Speaking is a MUST!"
horribal teacher
"She is an incredibly frustrating person to take a class from. Things are constantly being changed, as is the syllabus. She was up to four weeks behind in grading homework and other assignments. She was irresponsible. Hmmmm!"
"On-line Class: An Ok class, easy to get an A. Professor lacks communication skills, takes a long time to return emails. Announced that our grades are up but no one can check them - there is no link to a grade book. Has not returned anyones emails regarding the glitch. At the end of of his announcement he says: ""if you have complaints email me."" ???"
"She was one of the most attractive and nicest teachers I\'ve had so far, too bad she\'s taken. We had to do three speeches: one impromptu, one in groups, and one for our final. Only one exam and attendance was mandatory, not a lot of homework though except book reading. I got a B and suggest you take her. This was her last year at SFSU though."
"Brutal. Completely unapproachable, seems like he is lost in his own mind."
"Loves what she teaches. Talks about herself and LA a bit too much. Tests (midterm/final) are open-book and not hard if you have a basic knowledge of what is going on. Do NOT expect to have your own opinion, because she will force you to see things her way. Too picky about the final project...it\'s a non-major class but she expects a lot."
"Very willing to work with students individually; however, in-class time is often wasted with mistakes in the board and general confusion on her part. She doesn\'t mind if you don\'t come to class, it almost seems like she doesn\'t really pay attention to it. She\'s has a PhD but is really doesn\'t seam like it... gues that can be good and bad?!"
"Amazing professor and asisstant professors! There is a lit of studying group studying is a must but if you are interested i this field, he will stop at nothing to help. One thing he does not tolerate is cheating HAVE INTEGRITY IN THIS PROFESSION.. Keeps class fun and interesting. Do your part and youll pass!"
Most influential teacher in my education. Left university aware of how much I did not know. Got an A
"Purchase the book, attend every lecture, take pics of the slides, and DO EVERY EXTRA CREDIT opportunity he gives. At the beg/middle, I thought that I was doing so horrible I would have to retake the class. At the end, I ended up with an A. Try your hardest, even though the material is ridiculously hard. He is a nice guy, and you can get an A!"
"How many of you have ever heard of the Law of Mass Action...no one?...Well you haven\'t lived. This equation contains all of the trends you need to review and understand. Even love, maybe."
"An easy class but he makes you dread coming to class... which is important since you have a quiz almost every other time. He critiques every detail, but usually lectures in high detail as well. The book is useless but you need the online code for homework."
"Loved the topic but HATED the teacher. Josh can NOT teach and isn\'t clear with any assignment, which totally reflects on his bad grading system. He makes BAD analogies and doesn\'t care about student\'s opinions. DEF take this class, but do not take it with JOSH MILLER. Not only is he rude and disrespectful, he doesn\'t know what he\xe2\x80\x99s talking about."
"Martha is absolutely incredible!! Best professor you will ever have. She\'s extremely passionate and knowledgable and makes herself available for help. The two midterms are difficult, but as long as you prepare, you\'ll do fine. She really cares about her students and takes time to learn what everyone is going on to do with their degrees. Love her!!"
Dr. Beardsley is a great teacher. He is funny and most of the stuff is interestiNg but he does not let class out very early or cancel class. His test are hard too. If you study and go to class they are ok
"He is very smart,lecture fun,but HARSH GRADER!!!"
Best teacher ever! I failed this class one time before and passed with a B this time. If you are not good at math then he is the teacher for you.
"He\'s a nice teacher. He won\'t leave you much work compare to the other chem teachers. I don\'t know why people talk bad about him, I guess its the procrastinators that won\'t do work. If you don\'t read the book don\'t expect the professor to explain it all; this isn\'t high school, this is college!"
"She is a great professor, but attendance does major damage to your grade even if you pass all of your exams. You have to be there on time and read the textbook in order to pass."
petia\'s EU class taught with conor o\'dwyer was really interesting. petia is extremely knowledgable about the economic side of EU integration and explains things very clearly. tests come from her notes so come to class.
"very easy, very nice and always willing to help"
"Well structured presentations and a huge amount of background and historical information. Beyond history there isn\'t much to his Soc. of New Mexico class. If you show the interest he\'ll reciprocate, but otherwise don\'t bother sleeping through class--The material is interesting enough you should want to take the class."
"I loved Janice\'s class (I took jazz)! I cannot dance at all, but she never got on me for my two left feet; she just let me catch up at my own pace, and found the good parts of my, um, eccentric style. Very easy class, and VERY fun, even if dancing isn\'t a personal strong point. Her music and humor sense is also terrific."
"Easy class, gives you test format/what you need to know."
"There is no doubt that Dr. Dopke knows her stuff, but she does not convay it clearly. Her tests do not test on what she has taught, but more on what you SHOULD have taught yourself. I never had any problem seeing her after class. However, many times I was given a short or rushed answer. I would not recommend her if you would like to see an A for ch"
"Dr. Protomastro is the man! Best math professor I have ever had,"
"If you learned your math well in high school, take her. Tests are extremely easy and she will literally help you do the problems during the test. If you struggle with math, then don\'t take her. I did really well in the class because I already knew everything. She is mean sometimes but nothing too bad. I\'m satisfied with my results."
"She is kind of an intimidating teacher, but as a person she is incredibly sweet and helpful. She\'s really smart and knows everything that there is to know about Spanish. If you want to learn the language, take her. It\'s more work than the average Spanish class is, but it\'s worth it. It really isn\'t as hard as everyone says, just harder than usual."
Professor Henry goes over the chapters fast but explains the material very well. This was my second time taking ACCT because I couldn\'t understand my first teacher\'s accent. Mr. Henry is straight to the point but wants his students to grasp the knowledge and help them succeed. Textbook is essential to passing. Soo much homework. Take home tests!
"This class is kick ass, and Raskopf is a cool guy...he reminds me of Joe Pesci"
Great teacher! The writing isn\'t overwhelming. The lectures and discussions are clear and relevant to the work and internships done during the semester. She is very helpful in regards to this course and answering any questions you have. She cares very much about her students and is willing to listen when you need to talk about something. Loved!
"I did not understand anything in class, but he was prepared (without notes most of the time). Very helpful if you went to him. So read your notes and go to him for help. Now if he would only have followed the course description."
"she\'s a very nice teacher. though Philosophy is hard, she makes it easy for us. Though she doesnt speak fluently, she is a very kind teacher. Just do ur homework and particpate in class, u\'ll get a good grade on her. She also gives extra credit. I like her :D"
"Easy marker, funny, helpful! He is a really nice teacher. mUst choose his course!24"
"I really liked the way this class was organized. There is a lot of reading involved but, overall, it is a pretty easy class. The professor made it even easier because he constantly posts announcements and he will e-mail you back in a reasonable amount of time. I definitely recommend him. Getting a C was my own fault. I didn\'t study like I should."
"This is what you will endure if you take this. 17 essays 2-4 pages each. At least 1 test per week. The phrase ""You notice that?"" and ""Bare with me"" are used 10-15 times minimum every class (no joke). The textbook is the bible. You need to read everything she says or you will bomb the test. She makes common sense ideas overly complex."
"The book taught me more than she did. I wish she would\'ve just left us alone to go through the text on our own. She is VERY unorganized & scatter-brained, but she is a nice person. Unfortunately, nice doesn\'t count when I\'m paying for a class. I chose another program because of this class & because the Ofc. Admin. program is so unorganized."
"If you dont spend all class admiring her beauty, you might get away with a B because shell go through 3 chapters by the time youve written your name. But shes hot so its okay i guess."
The best professor there is! Hagen knows how to make a class about culture and turn it into something relatable for everyone. The best part is that he does not try to trick you on the tests! It is very straightforward. I am an accounting major and this class was absolutely amazing!
"The class was long and boring, but he tries to make it interesting. He is very likable, but tests are a bit ridiculous (test bank questons are lame). Huge group project (but good business experience). 3 SAP assignments which are time consuming and close to useless. really nice man though"
Brillant man and professor.
"Too many homeworks, each set more than twenty pages. This class is very unorganized and difficult to understand. He is not a fair grader at all. You never learn anything. Very poor grading system. Low quality and quantity class. Restricted professor. I ever never recommend this class. Dont waste your money and time. Avoid this class. Save your GPA"
He was a wonderful and helpful teacher.
"The most amazing math teacher ever. Funny and you can joke around with them. Assuming, your jokes are tasteful. He always says ""do you believe this?"" which makes me chuckle. Highly recommended teacher. And workshops are the best. He doesn\'t baby you; he treats you like a mathematician. The exams are mad easy. Just do the suggested problems."
Attending this prof\'s class was a strange experience.He starting assigning problems from page 628 of text and then the next assignment was from page 35! He showed 30 year old videos and his handouts were articles 15 years old.Utterly confused guy.You will learn little in his class and start hating Operations Management.
"He doesnt really teach, he will tell you that you need to do work outside of class. This is true and I agree but he doesnt help you with understanding. He will literally just say this is this and i dont have time to explain. Not very helpful especially when algebra is for highschool obviously we need more assistance if we are taking it AGAIN. smdh"
"Rob is awesome. He is the nicest guy and super helpful. These other 2 who took him for drug calc would never make it through nursing school if they think he\'s hard or unfair. He is dedicated, funny, and an expert in psych nursing."
Good teacher. A little difficult to understand but gives easy test and easy homework. A welcome relief from the more difficult classes during the day.
Make sure you read and hand in work on time. Follow instructions carefully and you will do well.
"Openly rude and disrespectful to students and professors. Only 3 grades so they matter. After our first test, he showed us a doodle he\'d done, inspired by how he thought we would do on the test. It was a giant F. He expected us to fail,then gave us fake grades that were higher than ours,only to reveal our worse grades after. Just read the book."
Mr. Tran is AWESOME! I have never had a teacher that was more understanding than him. I like to take some more classes with him.
"great teacher, happy, helpful and understanding, definitely one of the best."
"I highly recommend taking Hazel Jackson for Anthropology. It really is an easy A if you do the work, and she helps everyone to pass her class. She is absolutely amazing, if you have any problems doing the assignment she will work with you on it, and give you a chance to get everything in. She is also very funny, so... TAKE HER CLASS!!!!!"
Words cannot express the contempt I hold for this man. UNCLEAR LECTURES/NOTES. Let me put it this way: I\'m studying for the final right now and I have had to download lecture notes off the internet from OTHER UNIVERSITIES numerous times to understand the basic concepts.
"Smart, knows his stuff, but not a great teacher. Expects students to learn material on their own. Often disorganized. Seems to be quite apathetic at times."
"I dont know what to say....midterms are pretty hard, and he doesnt really tell you how hes curving it so we dont know how we\'re doing in the class. In lectures he pretty much goes over everyones head so its pointless."
Would not take her class again.
"You will be learning from the book, I learned nothing in class. He is a hard grader - little partial credit. He is not helpful when it comes to homework problems; we were able to ask questions in class *once* this semester. Oh, he told us he was going to give a take home final, then changed his mind on the last day of class."
Prof Mellion is a great teacher. He is very knowledgeable when it comes to History. Do all the take home research assignments and you\'ll pass! No mid-term. I would take him again!
"the class was easy because I already knew Algebra. But if I didn\'t know Algebra, I\'m sure I will have failed in her class. Good things: she is innocent. Bad things: boring class, take the grade out with any sill mistake, I\'m a great student in Algebra and I didn\'t get A because she puts X for whole answer if there is a very very small mistake."
"Perhaps the most unorganized class I have ever been in, yet it was also the class that I learned the most from in my entire collegate career. She inspired me to read a lot of books and do a lot of ground work and every single bit of it was worth the effort. She is also an excellent person outside of class."
"By far one of my favorite classes! Coming into this class, I was nervous about all the discussions we were going to have. Dr. Rehn-Debraal does a great job looking at each and every perspective, and opened my mind to so much! I would love taking another one of her classes if I had the chance. :-)"
"Really? People like him? Here\'s the deal, he GRADES homework. A lot of teachers allow you to make mistakes on your homework, but this is the thing bringing down my grade because he checks every answer, and if one part is wrong the whole thing is wrong. Only take him if you have plenty of time to devote to the class."
Dr.T is an excellent professor. She is VERY knowledgeable when it comes to animal anatomy/physiology. She is always there to help but you have to review the material (there is a lot) or else you will find the class hard. The lab helps with the class material but anatomy and physiology are different.
"Lectures are very confusing... Hard to understand her. The multiple choice midterms/exams werent too bad tho. Still she needs to slow down a bit, she goes way too quick with the material!"
"I took 3 courses with Dr. Gordon and found her absolutely helpful and knowlegeable professor. She brings many different techiniques that will enhance your learnign skills. Any student who looking to advance their knowledge must take her classes, she will teach you to differenciate between right and wrong of Academic Integrity Policy. She is very up"
"Very nice guy, has extensive background in supply chain and it shows. He\'s new to teaching, so go easy on him in that regard. He drops one test grade at the end of the course, so it could be worse. If you\'re having difficulties with the course, go in and talk to him, as he is accommodating to those who will put in the time to get help."
"This guy is a major ****! He doesn\'t give reasons when he marks papers- he is just belittling, and down right rude. He is the one who needs to think about things. Don\'t take this dude!"
"I wish I could\'ve chosen more Tags. He is very caring of his students. He does ask for weekly readings, however, gives you plenty of time to turn it in if you happen to fall behind. He gives take home tests and gives you a week to complete, which consist of 3 pages each question. Show up to class and you\'ll do fine."
Very Cool Prof! His courses are always interesting and fun!
"Can\'t say enough good things about this class. It isn\'t easy, but if you are alert and engaged it isn\'t hard either. You will learn a ton."
AMAZING
She is a wonderful professor that genuinely cares about her students. I went in for office hours and she was more than willing to help me understand the material. I was able to get a 100% on the second exam and have never taken stats before so she must be doing something right. I highly recommend taking this class with her.
"Tests are impossible and homework is ridiculous. Stay away if you want to pass physics. Like others said, he just reads the notes from the same files he posts online. Tests do not reflect the material taught. Stay away!!"
"Oh, i hate this teacher at all, also i hate the day which i have class with him. My advice not taking this class anyway, if you already taken it so drop it immediately."
"John Molloy is fantastic! I highly recommend him, but the Wiley Plus system truly complicated what should have been an easy course. The homework in Wiley Plus is super redundant -- only a complete idiot would need that much ""practice"" to get an ""A"" on the test. I was so excited when I finished Principles 2. I will never touch Wiley Plus again!"
"Great professor, who actually cares. Interesting readings, real world application. Teachers bigger picture - who life well being rather than drones on from the books. keeps it real! Has great love and enthusiasm."
Very funny and easy. Kept you awoke and laughing. But he explained everything very clear. Tests are easy. He gives a review before the test and its right on the money. No surprises on the test. Handsome too. Enjoy!
NEVER AGAIN!!!!!!!!!
"I though he was a very good professor. You had to work in his class, and he was very helpful if you showed interest. He was one of my better profs while attending Chico State."
"Class is hard but not impossible. Probably the most frustrating class I\'ve ever taken. Lectures are so vague, like reading someone\'s notes. Hardest part is the weekly ""review questions"" that are gradeno grade. The tests include questions that aren\'t on the ""review questions"" or even study guide, so if you think you\'ve studied enough you haven\'t."
"Excellent teacher, great lectures, easy tests. Multiple choice final we went over until everyone was ready. Got an A. Learn religion from him! One of my favorite professors! Everyone liked him. The people complaining didn\'t read the 100 page books and religion is complicated so come open minded!"
"She was the worst teacher ever! Her tests were so hard, I can\'t imagine that anyone got a decent grade in her class. She never answered questions in class, even when she would ask us if we had questions. She was very knowledgeable about the subject, she just shouldn\'t teach!"
One of the best professors extremely caring funny and makes his lectures fun
"Very professional and respectful. If you really want to feel you are at the university level and having someone who is trying to help you to learn and not there to give you hard time and make you suffer as simple as that, TAKE HIM !!! Notes are great and the exams are from the Notes , so what else do you need? He is clear about what he wants."
He was a great teacher and always kept me interested.
She will let us out like 15 mins early for a 3 hour class. Kinda boring I just tend to other stuff. Easy class just pay attention. Study Guides Open book and notes on final. Handouts. Easy ones. Interesting material she tries to make it fun. Shows us a lot of interesting videos. If you are taking 5 or more classes I recommend this one.
Mr. Brundage was easily the worst teacher i have had to date. Mr Brundage constantly insulted the intellegence of his students and was very unclear about what information was important for tests. This teacher should be fired by LCC. I would rather gouge my eyes out with a spoon before taking another course with him.
u think since its the most boring course ever they would try to get an interesting prof...apparently not. I want to fall asleep 15 minutes into his classes. Is an anal retentive marker. Makes exams then doesn\'t give enough time to finish them.
"Dr. Dolan is a great teacher. She cares about her students learning but she expects them to do the work and reading she assigns. If you pay attention, you\'ll enjoy what she has to say and you will learn a lot. I really like her."
"I graduated years ago from CSN, but today there are few people who have influenced me in my studies the way that Professor Defazio has. He wouldn\'t know me from anyone else. This is not an endeavor to help an acquaintance. I just remember the sense of fulfillment and appreciation for having great instruction from an awesome professor."
What he expects from you is very obvious and when he assigns presentations grab the ones in the begining. Very out going and eager to assist.
Not invested in material what so ever. Everything shown on PP\'s come directly from the book (don\'t purchase waste of money) and she reads straight from the slide. Only reason this class is hard is expectations are unclear & a majority of things that we were tested on we were never taught in class. Super subjective-- BUSY WORK GALORE
"I took a couple of classes with this guy, but Graphics was the worst! He\'s your typical ""I know everything and you don\'t"" engineer. The hw took me at least 5 hours a week, and it\'s for only 1 cr hr! I\'d say avoid him, but he\'s like the only professor that teaches ES138 and 148. He also downgrades a lot for missing class, so don\'t miss one"
"Dr. Lunceford is the most brilhant professor at Georgetown. His wisdom transpasses the quality required by the university equiping the students above expected. Brilhant, Full of Wisdom, and Inspirational"
"Dr. Lei is awesome. She knows the material very well and is very clear in her explanations in class. The exams consists of about 20 points of multiple choice questions, the rest is reactions and mechanisms. She sometimes will put a question or two straight up from HW or lecture. Organic chemistry itself requires a lot of time input but it\'s doable."
Shears is a very nice lady but not a great professor. She expects you to learn the material by yourself. If you stay after class she is willing to help you. Study EVERYTHING for the exams because the answers are not limited to the study guide. If you attend every class you get extra credit and she gives many opportunities to earn extra credit.
"Gomez is one of the most difficult teachers I\'ve had. If you don\'t write the exact way he likes, he will mark you down on your papers. Also, his comments in class are sometimes very difficult to understand, and he tends to get frustrated when nobody in class can answer his questions in a certain way. He WILL help you if you ask for it, though."
"Fadi is a hard teacher, there\'s no getting around it. He expects his students to work incredibly hard, and I needed that extra push sometimes to get through difficult assignments. He really cares about how his students do in the class. Fadi is a wonderful teacher and his sense of humor is adorable."
"At first I was a little unsure about this class, but I am really glad I took it with her. You have to come to class and participate. The workbook is so ridiculous to work through! Overall, she is really funny and nice. She tries to make the class enjoyable &the exams weren\'t too bad either. I\'d recommend taking her."
The only good thing is not having to have a book. He treats you like you are stupid and will help you only if you go to him. This was my most stressful class since I do not know much about computers. He gives all of the assignments on the first day of class and you have all semester to work on them- which causes procrastination and forgetfulness.
"Horrible.... I dont know how people can say shes clear... you can barely understand what shes saying. she doesnt speak loud enough. as a person, shes great, shes brilliant. as a prof, she has no idea how to teach."
What a great and nice person. Take her class. She is a good professor.
He is probably one of the most intelligent professors at UMD. He knows what he\'s talking about and makes a boring topic seem very interesting. Very fair grader. Very nice guy.
I am finishing up in the world civ 2 class i took with him and I am about to take another class with him in the fall. very good professor. not too strict and helpful. one of my favorite history professors. i have learned a lot!! -veronica
"I am not sure what this teacher\'s problem is, but you do not want her! First off if you mistakenly say one word in English she gets all red in the face and gets pissed. Second, she is just plain not friendly and her class is very annoying."
Really fun class! Really pushes you to achieve more!
Overall a good teacher. He`s an older guy that`s pretty quiet but it`s a nice easy-going class. Just be sure to study well before each quiz and study your past quiz`s before the midterm and final and you will receive a good grade.
The class it\'s not easy. I don\'t know what i know and don\'t since lot of exercises were almost completed we had to write maybe two lines don\'t know if i really can say I\'ve learned a lot. The professor is knowledgeable but i think his approach for this class was not the best. It\'s overwhelming if you are a beginner like myself.(C=79) one point :D
do not take this class with any other class and if you do not like writing.. He will kill you with all his weekly assignments. Good luck if you have already taken him..
"Birch is just a cool guy. He cares about his students and is there to help. He is a very sarcastic person but in an extremely funny way. Record his lectures and youll be good. No tests, only four essays and a final essay. If you pay attention to what he says in class he basically writes the essay for you. Take this class hes a great teacher."
ANT 400 was one of the hardest classes I have ever taken but I did end up learning a lot. Professor Novak favors her grad students way more than the under-grads in the class seeing it\'s a double listing. Do not take if you hate talking in class because she forces you to and participation is 30 percent of your overall grade.
"She really explains things well if you give her the chance, and although the second midterm is harder than the first one our class average was still 30 points higher than Toupadakis\' 2c class for both midterms!"
Dr. Nelson is the man! He is the sweetest old guy ever. His tests are sooo easy if you study the review questions off of his website. The over all class was interesting (especially his frog calls...) The final though was damn near impossible.
"I took an online class and it sucks! The workload is ridiculous, the exams are unpredictable. Beware!"
Very nice. Easy class for an A. If you really need to learn the material sit in on another instructors class and then take Dr. Berbrige for the A.
"Tough teacher, good lady"
"Wasn\'t a very interesting class, but she was fair and didn\'t ask too much from us - only one essay, group discussion over your chosen topic, and a few tests. Gives study guides for every test in outline form...know the outline and you\'ll get an A. Studying that outline is a b*** though at times. Extra credit opportunity every test. I\'d recommend."
"Very tough and demanding. Comes across as a bit of a misogynist, however, and it wasn\'t until late in the semester before I finally felt he was giving me the respect my programming skills deserved, regardless of my gender. Start assignments when he gives them, as you WILL need plenty of time to finish them."
"This class causes me so much stress! Two weeks left in the term and hardly anything has been graded. I have absolutely no clue what my grade is in this class. Plus, you have to work on a group project the whole term. Everyone in my group is very busy and don\'t want to put effort into the class. If you wanted to be stressed out, take this class."
"Wouldnt recommend anyone take this teacher. He doesn\'t like to explain any of his work, and he will mark your essay one way to revise it and then when it comes to grading it he will go the complete opposite of what he said."
"she thinks she is all that. on lectures she reads the slides with monotenous voice. does not strike interest in the subject. plays cheesy movies. asks to learn ridiculous stuff for the exams, like the names of the patients described in the cases. terrible teacher and her TA\'s suck."
Great Professor. Loved his class.
Horrendous. Class usually falls asleep and she seems oblivious. Packel should be teaching this course.
Talks about old days too much instead of important test questions... you are on your own in that class...just you and the book
"I took both Wis2040 and Wis2552, dont listen to those who said wis2552 is harder, everything is on quizlet and literally finished the class within 3 hours. If you need easy credit or gpa booste or credits to fill your schedule, these classes are for you. Although I took online, Moulton constantly reminded students about deadlines."
"Class is poitneless. 30 page business plan, which he doesn;t explains how to do. Consultations are stupid. Likes to talk about irrelevants stuff"
I HATE math but Mr. Mark is a good teacher. He explains things very clearly. Sometimes different from the explanation in the book - his way seems to be easier. He\'s in class 1/2 hour early if you have questions. Gives a Chapter Review before every test!! I could not have passed this class without them!!
sensei if your reading this i miss you soooooo much. i\'ve never had anyone so determined to get me to learn. you made it fun and interesting and awesome
Confusing assignments with many typos and last minute changes. Takes a long time to respond to emails and will answer the phone rarely. Would never take another class with this professor.
"He\'s a cool guy, and he makes the course interesting."
This proffesor is okay he talks alot but he does not like to be interupted. This class was easy you learn so much and does problems step by step. Take him he is easy.
He is terrible. The class is all busy work. He picks his favorites right away. If he doesn\'t like you he will grade you harder. For all the people saying they are what they are because of him are overstating. Whenever he is asked a question he uses a useless example to answer it. He thinks everyone will teach in an area where the kids want tolearn
i took typography 1 and Graphic Design concepts with him... he\'s one of the best professors just do all the work and make sure everythin its clean and neat! you\'ll learn everything u need to know about type with this guy.
"fairly good! amusing, very intelligent. sometimes a little unclear but always willing to help you out if you don\'t understand. study hard, memorize absolutely everything she says. her notes are good, but make note of WHAT she says, since the majority of the exams are based on that. can\'t stress enuf"
"I enjoyed Ms. (Mays) Thompson\'s class. In my personal opinion, she\'s a ""subjective"" grader in that she takes into account a student\'s personal skill level (very forgiving with some students, inconsistently not so with others). However, the easy-to-follow rubric can help ensure a good grade. Ms. Thompson is happy to meet outside of class."
Take her for all your classes if you can! The best teacher on campus. Very generous and very kind lady.
"I agree that Mr. Schultz is an excellent teacher; he makes class interesting and he is helpful and clear in his explanations. And yes, he IS a good-looking man. However, he is old enough to be your father."
Great teacher tries to make it fun. His jokes are like the one your dad tells that are really corny. Not hard he give you all the info you need
"Yes, he\'s cocky and overtly proud of his work, but rightly so. Deshpande\'s just a little too smart to be teaching, but he can dumb things down enough for his class to understand. Calculus a must for the class. I was lucky to have taken a calculus class and several years of high school physics before getting to PHY131. Just got to apply yourself."
"Worst lecturer I have ever had, he puts me to sleep, cannot keep on one train of thought. Just started using powerpoint and cannot operate his slides. Reads off his notes, and discusses sports instead of doing the lecture thus forcing the class further behind and prolonging his already dry lecture"
Kind of hard. Not that bad if you do hw and read the book. GoFind a easier prof.
good wealth of knowledge
"Great class. Shoney really pushes everybody to work hard, his assignments are many, but if you read and do the work you can be really successful. You can tell he likes to teach this class. You learn a lot."
"Dr. Reznick is a phenomenal lecturer, however, he focuses way too much on the little details and ignores the bigger picture. His midterms and finals are extremely difficult. Not only are his M.C questions half a page long for 1 question, his answer choices are all CORRECT but you have to CHOOSE the MOST RIGHT ANSWER CHOICES: A,B,C, AB, BC, or all!"
"Easy class. She didn\'t seem to know what she was talking about sometimes, but we did a bunch of really easy hands on stuff in class, and tests were straightforward and easy. The portfolio project took a lot of time, but it was really easy. Take it for an easy A."
"Professor Bejerman is absolutely amazing. He is so dedicated to teaching and can easily explain the things which look really difficult from the first site. I would never ever believe that Accounting can be fun, but he makes so many jokes that this become really fun. He always finds time to help students if they are stacked with something."
"It\'s not possible to say enough good things about Dr. Dude. Besides being extremely clear and easy to understand, he genuinely cares about students actually LEARNING things. Take any class he ever teaches. He\'s worth it!"
best teacher ever!! im gonna take her again
truly a great professor! Do not pass up your chance to have her---she is truly amazing!
"He\'s a really nice guy who really wants to make the world a better place. It\'s an incredibly easy A, and you do some interesting class activities. Sadly, half of the kids were a little ""two-faced"" in the class and really couldn\'t care less about stereotypes and racism. You gotta do 2 ""excursions"" and a final project that is a powerpoint. Take him!"
Dr. Hall is a great professor. She is very helpful and is approachable. I would recommend her to anyone.
"Super EASY, but also pretty boring. He\'s really helpful and nice...an overall easy A."
I took psyc 1010 for the first time and completely bombed it with like a 19 F if that is even possible. But my next round was with Dr. Ramirez. She was a wonder professor and taught it straight forward. No if ands or buts about it. Yes some of the lectures are boring but hey what class doesn\'t have them. I would highly recommend her class to anyone
Lynn is the sweetest woman alive. you can\'t help but love her. she makes you glad to be around her. very nice!
"Such a great teacher. Cheryl cares so much about her students and their success, she is truly a professor that cares that you\'re learning something and is always willing to help. Very flexible with assignments/grades within reason. Favorite/best teacher at Miami."
I like this class.
hardest class ever
Awesome professor and great class. I definitely suggest taking his college success class.
Hands down the worst professor ever. He is hard to understand and SO mean. He called the whole class stupid multiple times. I went to his office hours and he actually told me to shut up. And then told me to get out of his office. Avoid with ALL costs!!! Would give negative stars if I could
Not as bad as most would say. He\'s a nice guy but can be irritating with how much work there is and his grading criteria. Keep track of the due dates or else you\'re going to stress out. So many group presentations but very little time to work on them. Overall enjoyed the class mostly because it was a small class size and everyone was cool.
By far the BEST production teacher I have had at Hunter. He goes through everything so clear it made me very comfortable when it came time to shoot. Knows what he is doing.
He is an experience professor who always help those who really help themselves. He emphasis on the relevant tings that you must know to pass the class if you study. He is a good professor
"Class structure was a nice change of pace but the content of the class felt very much like a regurgitation of other entry level business classes with an international spin. Did not feel like I learned much from this class, and HWs and tests were long and only semi-related. Ended up with a MUCH lower grade than expected based ongrades prior to final"
well if your thinking about killing yourself take it with her there will be no hesitation you will just get there and pull the trigger.
"Took her twice. Good teacher, good attitude. Fair."
"I took this class during the winter session, and it was completely worth it. Fisher made the class a lot more enjoyable."
"She\'s a great prof. 4 interested committed ppl who study well She grades toughish but not unfair She loves 2 teach Bio, makes U better & makes U want 2 do well. If U dont have good study habit or a lot goin on, u will struggle in class. But As r definitely attainable. Qwzs & Tests r short essay but she cvrs everthing & the book helps. No tricks"
"Easy Professor, Easy Class, Actually understand the stuff and you will get an A"
Griffiths should go back to researching bark in the Kootneys. It boggles the mind how a teacher like this can publish a textbook and not believe in having any sort of structure when he teaches. Nice leather jacket****get
"Great teacher, very nice. Go the the ILC... I recieved A\'s on all my papers."
"Prof. Schatz Legal Writing course is a challenge worth facing. Students will not do well on the first few assignments, but those struggles will lead to better writing practices. I entered a lazy writer, but left much more refined. Schatz\'s harsh grading forces students to chose words wisely and become keen editors. He instills worthy habits!"
makes chemistry easy to learn. assigments relatively easy. sometimes hard to understand b/c of her accent but will do well in class if you do the hw and STUDY!!
"professor taught this intro level 100 class like it was a 400 level class. I\'ve never seen anything like this. It is a Gen Ed requirement we\'re not majoring in this stuff. Not to mention that she just shows these slides and reads right off them, she does not teach you, a monkey could hit next on power point and let me read the thing. the worst"
"He arrives late to class every single time, and then keeps us late!"
Very helpful and genuinely kind to every one.
Most energetic teacher I\'ve ever seen. He really works up a sweat in front of the class. Anyone with an interest in American history should take a class with him.
"I really enjoyed this class. Professor Balee is extremely knowledgeable on the topic and most of the reading material is very interesting. He stresses reading the material, but I got by with a high ""A"" simply skimming the assigned books and memorizing the lecture notes. Great class and very easy!"
Great prof. Really knows her subject. Great slides.
"I think midterm was hard (actually not) because i didn\'t pay attention. If you pay attention, you can do well on both midterm and final. Good luck!"
"He is biased against people who aren\'t East Asian Studies majors. I agree that once he has his opinion of you, there\'s no changing his mind. He loves to humiliate the non-majors in his classes. He grades ridiculiously hard and expects way too much of a class under 200-level"
"Save yourself from taking him. He does all the hard steps in his head and declares that everything is ""easy"". He does not care about his students passing, given that only tests are what makes up your entire grade. Tests are based on his VERY detailed lecture, which he expects you to remember everything he writes down. Do not take him."
Very good welder but most likely the worse teacher on campus. Ver unorganized and can\'t explain anything. took him for weld 108 and hes the last person you want attempting to teach math. Good guy though.
"Worst professor ever , don\'t take with him , he will mess you up , everything is hard , he grad harsher than any math teacher you have to get the right answer or everything is wrong , WTF ,he always aspect you to know everything and the sample exam is easy but when it comes to the real exam is hard , I passed his class with C with really hard work"
"I would suggest not wasting your time with this class. Of course as an aspiring writer you won\'t listen, neither would I. He offers no help what so ever, even if you attempt to get some from him. He stopped having us write halfway through the course so we could listen to stories about his life. I learned more in my high school fiction class."
"He is so boring, the second half of the class you almost fall alseep."
"Overall, this was a good instructor for Practice I/II and advisement. He brought in guest speakers and cool wellness exercises. However, he is a stickler for APA guidelines and comma use and seems as though he seldom gives out A\'s for the final grade in a course."
Covers to much information and expects you to remember like 6 chapters for one test. Tests are straight to the point but you have to study.
The best theory prof i\'ve ever had. so kind. so knowledgeable. knows his way around the piano like nobodys business. highly recommended.
"I hate Finance, I don\'t get it and I had to work my butt off. Bill is the reason I passed, from answering my questions, telling me I could do it and even asking how I was doing during both the midterm and exam. He cared."
She is so adorable and sweet! If you work hard she will help you as much as you can.
"Not really a hard teacher or a hard class for the matter, but goes off on wild bio spurts too often. very personable and easy to get along with."
Prefessor Novak knows a lot about sociology but he is very boring. He assigns multiple readings and once you get to class he just talks the whole period. It\'s hard to take notes in his class because he talks very fast and just writes one word on the board. He shows a lot of videos that you will have to analyze. Only one paper and final. No tests.
cours plate et prof encore plus
she\'s great
"Helped me understand what we did in MTH 231 and even though I didnt do so well in the course, he supplied our class with everything that could possibly be on the final. He really pushes you to be the best you can be!"
Awesome teacher
"HOMEWORK EVERY DAY, BUT IT\'S EASY HOMEWORK"
"Currently in Habinek\'s class. I love his lectures so much I had to rate him. He started off a little rocky, with major \'tech issues\' each class, and his TA\'s weren\'t able to give much information on the midterm so it was hard to study very far in advance, but the papers are easy, and if you keep up with readings (Sparknotes), it\'s a great class!"
She is a great teacher! she works well with all the students and its very easy to get an A in the course.
"There is no reason to make an otherwise easy class difficult just to lower the mean grade. Problem sets are too long, and seem to emphasize number crunching rather than the concepts themselves."
Counts quizzes as 50% of final grade so be prepared.
"If you want to truly understand math, please take Professor Abramyan. He is the best math teacher I\'ve ever had. We need more teachers like him, who truly care about their students understanding the material being taught. I truly recommend that you take his class. You will not regret it. He does give homework which will help you do well on tests."
He\'s awesome!
had her for drugs and behavior. very interesting class. good power points which were available on courseweb before class. also my most attractive teacher of all time so theres an added bonus...
"Really nice professor who makes Latin fun to learn. He wants everyone to succeed, and is very open to student questions and input. He\'s a tough grader on exams and takes class participation seriously (you really have to know your stuff and be consistent in class to get an A); however, he grades more easily on presentations and papers."
"Note: she\'s a grad student instructor. I really enjoyed her class. She was funny, had good examples, and made me really interested in the material. There\'s a fair amount of writing assignments and homework, and while they\'re not terribly hard, they also can\'t be done 15 minutes before class. She\'s also really helpful with office hours."
"Don\'t leave PC without taking a class with Dr. Barbour! He loves literature and he loves the students. His class was so much fun. He talks a lot because he has so much to teach. He is always open to student participation. He has a keen sense of wonder. A big fan of Jane Austen, ****ens, and TOLKIEN! A fantastic teacher. Great sense of humor too."
He\'s not extremely easy but if you\'re truly interested in the class you\'ll get a good grade. All quizzes are extra credit!
Good professor with a lot of experience. Don\'t take this class if you don\'t like being called out in class or speaking infront of a class. Takes points off for dumb things on exam but overall they aren\'t too difficult as long as you take good notes in class and study them.
"good teacher, christian ethics was not what i expected, everything was presented as ethical."
"This guy is no good, took in spring 05, stay away at all costs"
Favorite class all semester!
"Dr. Wilson is by far the best fit for this class. She is absolutely a teacher who wants to see if you understand. She gives you enough points to get a passing grade in her class. She is a tough grader, but it is for the best. I received a B+, if I had really buckle down, I would have received an A. If you have to take this class, make sure its her."
"She helped me whenever I asked, but failed the class for the second time...I just couldn\'t get it. nice teacher tho"
"very easy class, all lecture so need to take good notes. only 5 grades total: 4 exams, 1 super easy paper, just have to follow the guidelines and an easy A. I didn\'t even use the textbook just looked up the vocab online."
good teacher
"He is not like any other teacher I have ever had. He is intense in the classroom. And he is by far the best teacher I have ever had. I am a first year teacher and he spends so much of his free time helping young students and teachers, I don\'t know now how he does it. He works so very hard and he practices what he preaches - and he does preach."
"Very interesting class, and Dr. Zunz is a really enthusiastic teacher."
Avoid teacher if you don\'t know anything about computers. Her assignment sheets were a mess. Treated getting grades done on Canvas like a major inconvenience. She redid her syllabus/due date sheet twice in the quarter I took her class. The one positive is that she was patient with students that struggled on in-class assignments.
Dr. Voelkl is an amazing professor and you can tell he is very knowledgable and cares about what he is teaching! You know exactly what to expect from this class and makes assignments clear. Pay attention and you\'ll get an A. (P.S. he is literally Toby Flenderson from the office)
"HORRIBLE CLASS. He makes newswriting harder than it should be. Tons of hoemwork and 5 stories. He doesnt grade on rubrics or following the text book but rather if he ""likes"" the quotes you used or the way your story developed. AVOID takign him at any cost. The whole class has a C and the tests are hard. he\'s a cool guy but a horrible professor"
"Gayle definitely cares about her students and about doing a good job. Her classes can be really boring - but it might just be that the subject is boring. She takes it very seriously and can be strict about things. Group projects are frustrating in her class, but they always are. Basically: class was very boring, but she\'s a nice person."
She\'s very nice. You should definitely read the chapters and always bring your book. I found labs to be pretty cool especially b/c you get food. Lectures usually are alright and if you like the material it can be interesting.
Great teacher. I will recommend to other students. Do your assignments
"I\'ve taken Spanish 1 through 4 in high school and didn\'t learn anything, I learned and retained more info than I thought possible in his class, he does drills over and over again all class long and before you know it you\'ll have everything memorized"
"Do youself a favor. If you can take Ferguson, do it. Do it now. It\'s as simple as that. Hands down one of the best professors in the English department."
"Since the majority of the comments about professor fishman are negative, I am going to say something positive about him; he is a fun old grumpie dude. I took about four of his classes and they aren\'t really that hard. As long as you have the same views on issues that he have. However, If you view issues different than he does, you will fail."
Younhee might be really intelligent. But her communication skills make it totally impossible to tell.
great teacher
"While he puts forth a lot of effort to make the class enjoyable, his accent makes it impossible to pay attention. He obviously is really smart, he just cant always get is point across to the students. He wants you to make a good grade, and he works hard to make sure you do. However, I wouldnt recommend taking him if you arent good at math."
worst Spanish prof i ever came across. Do not take her class she is very hard and she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to know much Spanish. if u don\'t know much Spanis u are in for a very bad semester.
"not too hard, not too easy. Normal. He\'s kinda picky conducting wise, especially in front of people. But its nothing too bad. tests are easy. the examples are okay."
"Bad Teacher, mostly because he doesn\'t teach, literally."
"I learned a lot about her kids in this course. Her lectures rarely have anything to do with the material that she tests on. Exams are very difficult, my entire class got to redo many exams because of low scores. Our whole class had a hard time with her class. If you learn by reading and memorizing from the book, then you should be fine."
DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASS! HORRIBLE TEACHER !!!
"GREAT sense of humor...VERY funny. DO THE HOMEWORK or you WILL FAIL!!! Tests are tough, but SO much easier if you do the homework. I got an A by doing the homework more than one time through! You have to work hard!"
"Although I didn\'t attend her lectures too often and I got a B in her class, I would have to say that she is quite easy if you put the effort in (which is actually not too much). She seemed like an extremely engaging, sweet woman who is open to many ideas and discussions. Quirky sense of humor and I would take her again if I had the chance."
"Horrible person, not helpful at all, hated his class."
Do not take this class for an easy elective. The two papers are easy. I got As on both of them. There are weekly readings on books since she realized her other classes didn\'t really read. Tests are ridiculously hard and specific and grading scale is harsh. Got a B-
"Pfeiffer the best teacher to take financial accounting from. He is the head of the department so he knows his stuff. The class itself is hard but hes there to help. I slacked the first half of the semester and had to work hard at the end to barely get a B but if you are consistent, hard working and do the HW an A or B is well within reach."
"Love this teacher! she\'s interesting, knowledgeable, and very caring about her students....she\'s also funny and keeps the class lively...she loves her art!!!!"
"Although at times he may appear to be quite odd, he was quite enjoyable as a professor. He had interesting things to say (when he spoke) and he has a very cute and quirky sense of humor--I truly enjoyed his class and I learned so much about music that I didn\'t know before."
She isn\'t a bad professor. I would say defintiely go to class and pay attention and you shouldn\'t have a problem. Homeworks are online and some tests are take home. As long as you do your work it\'s easy. She teaches everything
"definitely take his class. he\'s one of the best professor\'s at smc. he knows a lot, but admits when he doesn\'t, and he\'s always wiling to take a step back for clarity\'s sake. he\'s a challenge though, and you have to work for your grade. excellent prof, tho."
"she is the best psychology teacher you can find in grcc. she explains things very well, and use real life examples. she will help you prepare for the test. the test is not hard with her study guide given. i wish i had her for all of my psychology class. very nice, good teacher."
"Great teacher. Really cares about her students and will answer any questions that you might have. Work load fluctuates by the week, but a very manageable class. Choose wisely for your end of the semester group project team members & you will enjoy this class! Attendance is a must or you will get lost!"
"The online class was too easy. You have assignments/test due every day but the answers are given to you word for word for your 2nd attempt. Discussion posts were interesting & a good chunk of the grade (not hard, just your opinions). Professor never replied to my numerous emails, neither did his student helper (many students said the same thing)."
"Creative Writing - Great teacher, though not for the timid. If you are in his class looking only for praise, his methods will seem unforgiving. I would also describe his methods as honest, helpful, constant, jovial, useful, and forthright. No one who takes is Creative Writing classes has any misconceptions about following a career in this field."
Excellent instructor! Made the material understandable and even enjoyable with his humor.
"SHE IS A GREAT, FUNNY, NICE TEACHER! SHE IS VERY HELPFUL AND WANTS HER STUDENTS TO DE THEIR BEST! SHE GIVES EXTRA CREDIT AND GRADES FAIRLY! TAKE HER FOR ENGLISH!"
"Noticed he was getting a lot of negative comments here. He knows the material very well and presents the information clearly, an overall solid teacher with a positive attitude. The negative reviews possibly come from the fact his class comes right after another therefore the average person is too tired to completely focus."
"Ethics in Business: not an exciting topic by any means. But the prof is very clear on assignments and grading. Overall, a decent class, but with a lot of reading and writing."
"I LOVED taking A&P with him, it was much easier than I expetected it to be. If you are struggling in any way he is there for you and is super willing to help you with anything that you are finding difficult. He was always telling jokes and laughing at himself which made the class more enjoyable. He was my lab instructor before and was just as good!"
"Unique teaching style. Lots of Bonus, many test questions are directly from the PowerPoint. a boring topic, but an easy A"
Don\'t take a class with this professor. You won\'t pass. His exams don\'t reflect anything taught. Expect to make 30\'s on the exams even after studying for hours. By far the worst class I have ever had to take.
"Prof. Stone has a passion to teach. The tests and lectures are like 2 different things. Lectures help bold out main points, but you literally have to know everything in the book or your screwed."
"Tran cares about her students, but her methods aren\'t particularly effective. She takes a ""figure it out by experiment"" approach that is completely useless without an initial lecture of the material. We all usually feel lost, and I think it could be easily remedied if she reconfigured her curriculum. I would love to see step-by-step handouts!"
she was the best prof. i ever had. she is very soft spoken but if have a problem and ask her about it she will go over the whole thing. she is a more then a fair grader and will give you about a million times to pick up your grade. if you fail her class t
"Really cool, and he was there to answer questions."
"He always has a way to explain a concept in a fashion that is not only incredibly precise, but is entertaining and makes sense to the casual citizen. That takes talent, real talent. Even though he is an easy grader, he covers a lot of facts in his class and it\'s VERY enriching! LOVE this teacher!"
"This guy is a great person and a great teacher. Assigns homework daily, but doesn\'t grade it. Your grade is based on tests only, which are hard if you don\'t do the homework. He is a great professor, but due to the amount of material covered this class is not easy. If you are not willing to work don\'t take it. If you are, Williamson will help you."
"If you are good with keeping up with deadlines, this class is extremely easy. The material is also easy to learn because it is interesting and useful. She offers lots of extra credit each week and the final is extremely easy. Definitely recommend taking this course!"
"shes very nice.explains things with examples which is helpful.wants u to do well. homework instructions are easy to follow.gives an outline on what to expect on test, but u have to read the chapter also. i would take her again"
"Very nice lady, understands that people take this class to fulfill art requirement. Likes to see people try. Got an A in her class. How? not to sound cliche, but practice makes perfect. She will pick up on if you\'re trying hard. If you took piano before, don\'t tell her and get a REALLY easy A"
"this guy should not be teaching at JJAY. he is rude, unclear of what he wants from the students, extremely unhelpful. AVOID, AVOID, AVOID."
BEST professors I\'ve had at Farmingdale. Knows his stuff with lots of experience so it\'s not just out of the book. Lectures were 4 hours long (summer session) but he made them interesting & the time went by quickly. Good stories and good sense of humor. Tests are a breeze if you do the reading. Definitely would take another class with him.
"prof. greatrex is one of the best professors i have had. she is so clear, and is always willing to answer questions and take time out to help anyone. her lectures are really good for note taking and her exams are not impossible. definitely take her, she is one of the nicest professors at fordham. she knows her stuff too!!"
Idiotic she live her life think ALL about her career if you taker her class be aware that she always will said ?Professor Mellissa Campbell is a PR? I did not learn ANYTHING in her class. don?t taker her class eve if she is only one who is teaching.
Not very nice
"Serkan is great. To try and entertain the notion that he is ""unprofessional"" is absurd. The problems from the Class Pak are essential to doing well on the exams. Very nice guy and is always willing to help."
"I took anatomy with Dr. Molnar, she\'s great lecturer. she draws pictures to help you envision the material. She gives 5 lecture exams and 5 lab exams and gives extra credit in each exam. Anatomy is not easy but if you study hard, you\'ll be fine."
"Ok guy, but not a good professor. Very vague on his lectures and is bad at answering questions. Had review sessions before tests but they didn\'t help really. Read everything he assigns."
"Honestly, her lectures are packed with information and go at a fast pace. But she makes podcasts available for you to go back and listen to. If you listen to the podcasts and do the practice midterms you are provided with, you should pass. Her tests are fair, and she doesn\'t give you any trick questions. Also, she lit and watches the anime Hetalia."
"Knows his stuff really well but picks obvious favorites and makes unwanted comments based on students answers in class. ""You\'re from Mexico and you don\'t even know where so-and-so is?"" ""Do you even read the newspaper?"" ""This is so basic and you should already know this."" Just kind of rude considering it\'s an introductory course."
I took Prof. Brook\'s summer class in 2011. She explained everything very well and was very helpful. I would highly recommend her.
SEXIEST MAN ALIVE!
Definitely one of the favorite profs. Go Jeff!
He is not clear about the requirement. No sample test posted before midterm. He just read out (not loud) but really fast two questions of past paper. What is the point of doing this? Can not learn much from his class. Can not find any logic of his lecture. American economic history is really an interesting topic. But he teaches it in a terrible way
Was very specific in his expectations. Did not communicate well about the end of term research paper and not needing to turn it in if the exam scores weren\'t high enough. He knew the material well but didn\'t give a lot of clarity in teaching it.
"Difficult class, but you really learn the material. If you have an A, you don\'t have to take the final, but there is no extra credit of any value. Levin has enthusiasm for her topic. Her ppts are fun and simple, but don\'t plan on getting out early. Uses entire class time efficiently."
Best Teacher EVER!
"Doc is an incredible person. She is so helpful when it comes to anything from coursework, to even talking to you and working with you if you\'re having problems at home. She is great at lecturing, and makes really boring material quite enjoyable. I\'ve taken her for 270, 271, and Nutrition next semester. If her class isn\'t full, jump in quickly."
"This guy is the bee\'s knees. I propose a drinking game to this guy. Every time he says ""fascinating"" or ""really interesting stuff"" you take a shot. I guarantee it you won\'t make it through the class, you\'ll be wasted off your ass. I\'m taking this guy again. Any guy with a sweet beard gets my vote."
One of the best math instructors.
Jiji is a great lecturer and explains the materials very well. His book is well written and easy to follow and study from. However he is a harsh grader. Tests are somewhat difficult and tricky. Does not give much partial credit. Projects are very vague and difficult. Very time consuming class.
The best professor I\'ve had in my entire academic history. If you put forth the effort he will do everything in his ability to help you succeed. Ask him questions I\'m class and afterwards and he will take the time to clarify anything. His projects can be long and challenging so don\'t put them off if you\'re new to programming.
brings animals to class. makes the class interesting...
he is funny and an overall good teacher tho his lectures are long the class is fairly easy
"I encourage to take this class on it\'s own or with easy classes. Always go past class time, VERY STRICT NO PHONE POLICY (seriously, don\'t test her), directions are not very clear or very confusing, very particular about attendance, if you miss one class, you\'ll spend the rest of the sem. catching up. The info she presents is interesting but hard"
"Rabble rabble rabble! Study labs, out of class requirements, and dept presentations blow. WAY too much work for a 2 hour class, it\'s like we\'re already expected to know how to engineer."
"Too many papers and the amount of work required for this course is completely unnecessary. The website is very poorly organized, and not user-friendly. I would encourage anyone who is trying to fulfil the ethics core to avoid this time-consuming class. Do not let the ""online"" portion fool you! And be prepared for a lot of Jesus talk."
he rarely gives quizzes and if he does its open notes and by open notes i mean that you get to use a 8x10 flashcard of things that you might not remember
"Prof Trevenen is super helpful, extremely fair, and very thought provoking. She introduces me to the most insightful articles, and I am always so enthusiastic for her classes and what I will learn during them. She is a beautiful person and excellent prof."
The only issue that I had with Radu\'s class was how the assignments were laid out in blackboard. Other than that class was great.
"Melissa is a clinical instructor & struggled to be competent at it. She never gave a real answer to any question, tough grader, gave unnecessary work & throughout previous semesters has been known to be rude to her students. She is not therapeutic in any way & yet seems to think highly of herself. She\'s nice enough, that is.. if she likes you."
"She assigns a ton of reading every night. She\'ll randomly call on you and lectures are very boring. If she likes you, she\'ll give you a good grade. If she doesn\'t like you, she\'ll grade you very hard"
"He\'s class is not as easy as everyone else says it is. His topics are interesting, but his tests are made so that missing ONE multiple choice question can result in the loss of 5-6 points!!! Make sure to read all the material, as you\'ll never know when he\'ll have a quiz."
"pretty boring, not very interesting at all, i felt as tho he should have been sitting in the class instead of teaching it. but he did let us out early almost every day :/"
awsome prof. explains everything very well. easy class
"took the weekend course, 3 sats/suns, he was great, made it fun"
"It\'s hard to hear him, and he has a hard time hearing us because he is elderly. But a good-hearted person. Not a very hard class either. There are a lot of papers to write, but he doesn\'t require them typed which was nice."
"She is really nice, but she is not a good teacher. If you can self- teach yourself this might be the class for you. Attendance is mandatory! She gives actual written test which are extremely hard. Class was fun at first but the class had too many students so it was hard for her to help people. Most people dropped the class."
hard to know if she is truly on the student\'s side or if she\'s really just on her own side
This class was painful. I never knew where I stood because she was always way behind on grading and no good feedback was provided. The things you lost points on seemed very inconsistent and subjective. You have to be a mind reader to get full credit for any of the papers.
"The assignments in class will 99% of the time be on the test. She does a good job of emphasizing what material will be most important. Her weekly online quizzes are either repeated on her tests or more difficult than her tests. If you google an online quiz question, chances are the answer is there but make sure you actually know the answer."
Prof. Haag is a cool guy and he loves to teach. Although I\'m not very good at calculus I like attending his class because of his energy.
"I have taken four classes with Doc. He is hands down my favorite professor. He knows what he is talking about & you can learn a lot if you want. It\'s not a big deal if you miss class, but he is really interesting so try and be there. If you write well, you will make an A. He encourages you to have your own opinions. Plus, his hats are awesome."
"Rangel is extremely confusing and very hard to understand. Gives lots of homework, and is a super tough grader. His tests are nearly impossible to get a good grade on (I studied a LOT and still didn\'t). His directions for assignments and papers are not clear at all. He doesn\'t answer questions and doesn\'t provide help. He is a great native speaker."
He is awesome. Very helpful and very forgiving. If you put in some effort you will get a B no problem. I wish he taught advance to. He repeats material to make sure you get a firm grasp. Excellent language teacher!!!!
He\'s way too confusing and isn\'t clear about anything! You ask him a question and he answers with something completely different. Goes off topic and expects you to understand everything he says.
"Make no mistake - she doesn\'t play around. Read the book, study the PPTs, and go to class. This class reqs a lot of work - simulation, case analysis, exams, 25pg paper, 30min presentation. Exams are tough but she grades fairly - will seek input on ?s that many got wrong & throw out ?s if presented a valid argument. I liked her but she is NOT easy."
One of the sweetest best tempered teacher\'s in all of BC. She cares so much about her students and works overtime to get the class involved in her lectures. In a word she\'s awesome!
"This is the second time I have taken this professor, and he is the easiest math professor I have ever taken. I received and A both times. He gives you 5 homeworks and 5 tests. The homework is exactly like the test except for minor changes, and he goes over a similar version of the homework before it is due. Attendance not mandatory"
"pretty easy, but places a lot of weight on attendance. he makes classes interesting though :)"
I guess working students dont have anything better to do than look at his rediculous website
he gave us very clear instruction on assignments. It\'s very easy to pass as long as you have done all your assignments on time
"Afraid of a challenge? Avoid This professor. Just know you will learn more from this professor than the others, because of the challenge. Tougher tests, but quizzes can help the grade too. FANTASTIC PROFESSOR"
He truly is the greatest teacher in the world!
"Professor Willweber\'s class was interesting because it is not a regular Math class and she tells you that on the first day. I did find her class at times challenging because of the material, but she is very helpful and will answer your questions."
"Love this teacher, she takes the time for you to succeed .lots of work but stick with it ."
Definitely cared about his students and their grades.
"She isn\'t impossible but she does expect a lot. I was surprised that the class was taught in Spanglish..at the 400 level. Don\'t worry too much about the readings, she will go over all of them in class. If you don\'t have an answer to her question, no big deal because she prefers her interpretation. Lord of the Rings and Har"
Prof Mar is the most amazing philosophy prof I\'ve ever met. He encompasses every quality that a philosopher should have. He is the quintessential philosopher and nothing makes me happier than knowing that I\'m lucky enough to be taking a class with him.
very easy... class was a discussion and was very enjoyable.. she helps when needed and grades fair. i got a B in her class.
"easy class, you really don\'t have to put much effort into it and you\'ll get a B or C. Just to warn you her class is really boring most of the time and you have to attend b/c it counts and she put random things she talks about in class on the test."
"I actually took both Intro to Geo and Oceanography from Emily; plus as the Earth Science lab manager she\'s helped with other classes I\'ve taken too. She is very patient and simplifies things as much as needed for clarification. Her classes have light workloads compared to others in the department, yet you learn a lot."
"she is a great dance instructor, she taught me a lot, and made me see more in dance besides from what i already knew and love. she made me feel better about my physical apperance and helped me improve my dance techniques. i love taking her classes, and i hope i can continue."
He was really there to help me in many ways. He really helped me grow and develop my ways in writing and was very patient with things I had problems with. He also was very caring and understanding and helped me a lot:)
"Was a pretty interesting teacher, had an interesting story for most everything. Explained everything in the best manner possible, and did a good job teaching not only what the class consisted of, but also life lessons, and useful business knowledge. Highly recommended as a teacher."
"Teaches property material like its a CLE course (which is his first teaching love). On the other hand, gives excellent practical advice (even if it is a bit rudimentary) on how to break down the elements of a deal."
"Miller knew what he was talking about and I learned some interesting things in his class. Personally, I didn\'t find the lectures too intriguing. The midterm and final weren\'t hard- just make sure to take decent notes during his lectures. Overall, Miller was an easygoing professor and I would take him again."
"Campus Choir is awesome, and Witvliet is great. Very passionate, knows what he is talking about, and works a choir hard, but you won\'t even know it. Take him if you get a chance."
"Such a nice guy, but not a very good professor. Honestly learned nothing from him all semester & self-taught the entire course the week before the exam. His slides are very confusing, and his lectures aren\'t much clearer. He crammed really important topics into like one class to we can spend the rest of our classes on access to justice."
One of the best teachers I\'ve ever had. Makes french much more interesting. Has a great sense of humour and is very accomodating to her students. Will bend over backwards to ensure that the entire class is satisfied. Allows assignments to be redone in order to ensure you get a great mark.
"Kayla is awesome! Attendance points are taken every time, but she makes the class fun and enjoyable! There\'s at least one assignment per week and it\'s easy! Tests were take home! Always willing to help you with anything you may not understand and always has activities every class! Definitely recommend her!"
Maggie is okay. Just okay.
"Gives too much homework for a speech class. For 3 units it was too much work. The essays have to be written a certain way how one would have to write for an english class. Want a hard speech class in which you will ""LEARN"" then take this class. Talks through all class and does not use time very wisely."
"Will likely be his last review as this was his last semester. He\'s a really nice professor that is extremely knowledgeable about accounting. Passionate about teaching, and has lots of experience doing so (50+ years). Great professor."
"Easy class, helpful, gives extra credit, no text."
Lot\'s of reading for this class. Very available outside of class. Encouraging and supportive.
This man is so sweet. He is extremely knowledgable in his field. Very understanding and easy to talk to. I would definitely recommend him. If you need help go to his office hours and he will clear everything up. Love this guy!
Best professor ever! Both the classes I took with him were my two favorite classes. He\'s hilarious and makes everything very interesting. I actually took his class last year but I\'m writing this now anyways because he was such a great professor that I had to
"You could hear her chewing gum during the lecture. It was very distracting. Most of the online lectures were not in the textbook. When she did get to the slides, she was all over the place and it was hard to follow. She went from the slides to lecturing about other things quickly. She didn\'t teach how to do a contract. You were on your own."
great prof!!
Very good teacher.Explains math very well.
Very good teacher with great personality. I like his teaching style. A very helful class.
"Dr. Askew is a good guy. I had him for Thermo, stages, communications, mass and both of the unit ops labs. You have to put forth some effort, but if you keep up in his class, it\'s no problem."
"Dr. Blackwell is a genuinely caring person and clearly wants to help students succeed. Very approachable and sensitive to students\' needs. However, I did sometimes feel like she was disorganized...."
"Very good professor! Class is interesting. Only negative is that you have to do well on the tests because there aren\'t many other grades to make up for them. Just attend class, take notes, and do the labs. Labs aren\'t too difficult either."
She is very helpful and will explain if you dont understand something in lecture class.
"If you need a history class take him. He is very nice, easy grader, and always ends class at least 45 mins early. Also he gives you the exam questions before hand."
"Wonderful guy, inherently boring subject. I had a hard time focusing on hour-and-a-half lectures about various types of paint. If you have to take this class, make sure you either take good notes or get them from someone else. Otherwise, exams will be a pain. Oh, and the labs are really fun. I had electrics with Mark and scenery with Rich."
"Martinez is a solid professor. For any language students you\'re going to have an easier time with 2-4 years high school experience, but not 100% necessary. Don\'t skip out on lectures, keep up with online HW, and study for the tests and you\'ll be fine. Gave us significant chances for extra cred on tests. Expensive book but that\'s not his fault."
"She knows her subject VERY well. You hardly find teachers who do not read off their notes. There were many changes in the syllabus and delays in returning the exams and quizzes. She can be bossy at times but that\'s because students do not listen or do not follow instructions. Overall, she really prepares you."
"Wonderful teacher, motivator, recruiter and a guy who got things done. The Music Department has collapsed since he left. Quality and quantity has crashed. The jazz program was one of the best in the midwest and his percussion students were could compete with any in the country."
He\'s a horrible grader.
"This course was a horrible experience for me. I went into the course enthusiastic about learning the basics of computer skills. By the end of the course, I was greatly disappointed by what we had been presented. I felt like I had not learned a single thing correctly due to the presentation and organisation of the course material."
His tests are very very difficult and there are not enough assignments given to bring up your grade.
"A good lecturer, but can easily rub you the wrong way. His sense of humor is sometimes demeaning, and students can be offended in this class. His office hours are a mess, in that his paperorganization is all over the place, he reclines like its a social event, and has tendencies to make you feel stupid, AND point it out..."
He never answers his emails. He can\'t explain concepts very well and he is not very good at explaining the R-Software we use in class. He tells you to google R-codes. You\'re the damn professor! You should have knowledge of the material you are teaching. He loves cats so much that he uses statistical studies of cats. Do something more interesting.
He doesn\'t offer any extra credit. You have homework everyday that you need to turn in the correct way. There is a group project and everyone has to speak. Fadil is easier ive taken both and I would take fadil again.
I took Gen Psych online and it was sooo easy! I do not agree with the pp that the tests are flawed since I made several 100\'s (maybe he fixed them). The tests come straight from the book so if you read the chapters you will do fine. Tests are open book so know where to look and you can find the answer. Easiest class I have had online.
"Avoid him if you can! I was scared to take his class because of everything I read here, but I did anyways because other options didn\'t fit into my schedule. I absolutely regret it. I should have taken it in the next semester."
"I found him difficult to understand at the beginning but as the term progressed he got much better. Very easy final, you just have to make sure that you keep up. Kinda arrogant, not as funny as he thinks he is. Very good notes, and very willing to help students who put in an effort"
"His lecture is very comprehensive and you will learn a lot if you love the subject he talks about. He is humorous only if you interact with him in class. If you just sit and listen, you will find him boring. His projects and tests are very hard. You need to put lots of efforts into it, but you will learn so much if you are a dedicate student."
"She hands out packets that she teaches from word for word, which are confusing to begin with. If you\'re good at memorizing by recognition, you\'ll do well if you do nothing but study for this class. There\'s so many things on the tests that don\'t make sense and that she didn\'t go over. She\'s also spacey and goes off on random tangents in class."
"Easy class...Exams questions come directly from the sample tests she posts. Make sure to get in a good group (project is 30% of grade). Lectures are a waste of time, but she takes attendance. She mostly talks about her experiences and constantly reminds you of how she went to Harvard. Overall, you learn nothing."
he seems okay...so far
"Wonderful prof... she is so nice, but a bit slow in getting assignments or grades back. She\'s really helpful and friendly. Not too hard a marker either. Her subjects of readings are quite interesting and the dynamic of the class can really make this a great course. This course really helps you out in other classes as well."
Made the research paper aproach less complicated. Always had open office hours to answer questions. Happy I took her class.
Kyla is great! Super fun and very informed on her subject matter. She will basically give you the test answers if you go to class and listen. Star your notes when she says and you\'ll get 100%s on your tests every time. Kyla took a subject I typically dread and made it a class I looked forward to every day. I cannot recommend her enough!
He is a good professor and his class is pretty easy. If you show up to every class it counts as a 100 of one of your test grades. Test are just like what he does in class and you get a cheat sheet on everyone of them. The hardest part of the class is using matlab but if you have learned it in another class you will be all set.
"Dr. Liao is very difficult to understand, though she is funny and relates a lot of the material to real life. Be sure to do all practice problems. If have issues, she IS there to help you. You have to make yourself known. She does practice sessions from time to time. Very important to have taken Stats right before if at all possible. I didn\'t."
"Dr. Brustad is awesome! I loved this class. His lectures are clear cut, as well as his expectations of his students. He seems to have a wealth of experience in this field and has some of the greatest stories to supplement key points!"
If you get this class with Reg Bell as the second prof. it will be the best class you will ever have.
"of 25-30 profs over 5 years this guy was my fave, the best"
shes annoying and is mean she is a terrible grader i do not recommend any one to take any of her classes
"I tell everyone having to take Psy 150 to take him if possible. a gret teacher, personable, i love the stories from his private work. i still remember some of his lectures!"
"Really good professor, enjoyed his classes. He teaches at Ashoka University now. Readings are SUPER important and class is very fun. :)"
He is one of the best pianists in the U.S. and a wonderful and caring person and teacher. It is difficult to find a better musician than this amazing pianist.
She knows her stuff and is really passionate about it! She made class interesting by telling us her opinion as well as letting us discuss peices. I only took this as an elective but I really enjoyed it! She\'s an awesome woman.
Lectures are hard to pay attention to because she reads straight from the book. Essay tests are not enjoyable and must be accurate in order to receive full credit. Stickler for attendance. She\'s an interesting woman when she shares her life experiences but not without her quirks. Stickler for attendance.
"Horrible just horrible. Do not take this class, she just talks, you will fall asleep and puts on a movie than talks nonsense. Bad grader, i failed her class because she didn\'t give me the topics for the paper which later she said it was not her concern. Just a horrible teacher and possibly person."
"suppose to be RT 29. No any rate yet, add more on her/him.thanks.Have to rate it randomly or not allow to submit it."
"she\'s so approachable. she doesn\'t make u feel dumb at all, and she can relate to the stuff we go through at mudd since she went here too. she\'s funny and fun."
great teacher! he\'s easy to understand and if you like spanglish he uses it it!
"Rivard is a cool guy. Tests are take home and easy! He has a lot of experience and shares what he knows. He doesn\'t really like elementary aged students, but knows what he is talking about. He\'s a real person and will treat you with respect. No homework, but he does take attendance."
"This class is both extremely fascinating and challenging; I didn\'t know anything about computational genetics before, but I\'m now interested in pursuing this important discipline of biology in the future. Dr. Vision uses a lot of interesting examples to explain complex (and potentially boring) topics. He is clear, fair, and obviously passionate."
Orin gives the most interesting lectures. He\'s really engaging and teaches in a very lively manner. Also a very interesting guy.
"Expect to read or else you will not pass, (readings are relatively short though). She posts nothing online so be prepared to come to class and copy them down. Extremely friendly and helpful semester, genuinely cared about her students. She definitely appreciates those who converse with her. Tests are largely based off of the readings. Great prof!"
"Horrible teacher. I hate how he always talks about his family, which has nothing to do with the class. Never teaches, only assigns hw and expects you to have it done. DO NOT TAKE THIS GUY! Go with go with the other accounting teachers!"
"Mr. Stokes, tries to teach and I respect him for that. However, you\'re better off learning on your own. Also his test are hard so good luck to pass them. Do not take this teacher if you can avoid it."
I would say that he is the best teacher at ferris take him if you can!
"Albert Chau makes a great prof. Eloquent and fluent, Albert Chau is an effective communicator and a stud. He takes on any questions you have and he answers them well. He does that thing where he doesn\'t complete examples, but I\'m sure if you asked him he would complete them for you. Like he doesn\'t finish an integral, somtimes. Funny guy, too."
"His lectures are pretty boring, but he explains things thoroughly and does well answering people\'s questions. Quizzes are open note, book, computer, etc. Tests are kind of difficult but if you take notes during class and study them you\'ll do fine."
"Awesome professor. Go to class and actually participate and she is very easy going. Very fair on grading essays and you always have a chance to revise. Highly, highly, recommend"
"Dr. Kelly is a great instructor. There is a lot of work...but, she is willing to help in every way. She is a great advisor who desires for her students to take the correct courses towards their degree. She is top notch!"
"Lots of fun. It\'s not an easy A, you will have to work for it. But if you talk to him, he\'s always willing to compromise or just give you some feedback on what you wrote. Attendance is definitely important though."
Scott was really chill. He was pretty funny and was very laid back about grades and teaching in general. I walked out of there with an A-. If you get him you won\'t be disappointed.
at this point in the semester he should have run out of material to talk about himself... i have never unwillingly learned so much about a teacher. This must be therapeutic for him.. kinda sad really... you make enough hire a shrink talk about pertinent information about the course for a change...
"I took Bus Law I this summer,and I was scared to cram everything into a few weeks, but he made the class very enjoyable. He is a very down to earth Professor! His exams are hard, but if you come to class every day and do your homework, you will still get a good grade in his class."
"She is such an angel. Loves her students. If you think you\'re bad at writing, take this class. She\'ll make you feel like Shakespeare."
Unless you want to fail do not take. He mumbles and has a heavy accent. You will fail. My class started off with 35 students ended with less than 10.
She was an AWESOME professor. Very helpful and gave a ton of extra credit. If you can totally take her. Also you will love her stories.
"animal phys is hard, but is def. a good class to take. plus, wise is friggen awesome!"
Do not ever take this class unless there is no more seats in community college
"HAHA, yeah I agree. He made class SO worthwhile for many reasons. He was nice to look at, but more importantly... he did a DAAAAMN good job of teaching that class! I did really well and only bc his teaching is VERY clear & he made the class AMAZING! GREAT job Dr. Cain! Look fwd to having you again!"
A very rude professor. She picks on students and tries to make them feel small. The worst professor I have ever had at SFU. I do not recommend her at all.
"So helpful. If you ask her for help, she is very willing to help. There is a lot of work, but that\'s because it\'s Spanish and there is always a lot of work. Make sure to go to class, because partication is worth a lot."
"Dr. Gengenbach is an excellent professor. The course is hard, it\'s supposed to be, but he really tries to make sure you understand it. If you don\'t, make sure you ask questions, he will help you. If you do the work, you won\'t get lost."
"Very Fun Class, the class moves a bit fast but she makes it fun and relatable to everyday life, there\'s some opportunity for extra credit so do that if you can. She cares alot for her students"
I really liked Alexander! His lectures were very straight forward and he was very honest about what was going to be on the test. He was a little scatter brained at times which made things difficult sometimes.
"great teacher. she is really helpful, and for the first time i really understood math!"
Prof. Morrow is an amazing teacher. She knows her stuff and is dedicated to her students. She is one of the BEST professors at NECC!
He\'s a very good professor.
"I loved his class. I learned a lot, and really enjoyed discussing the stories we read. If you go to class, you will do well. I would highly recommend him for LBST 301."
"Nesbitt has a ridiculously monotone voice, but it makes the handful of jokes she tells funny. Class is ridiculously interesting, there was no text book which I actually wish there had been. Exams are difficult, and make up 100% of your grade. Don\'t expect to do that well."
Never had such a good teacher.
"Professor is very enthusiastic and makes you want to listen, but the actual class kinda sucks! I guess if you really like art history take it bc he\'s an interesting lecturer, but the paper was ridiculous and made no sense at all, the midterm and final are dumb. The only thing worthwhile in the class is the professor."
"His lectures are a little confusing, but he is a VERY fair grader, making this class extremely manageable. He is also very open to helping students if they do not understand something. I really enjoyed having him as a teacher and I would take another class from him!"
"Theresa is an amazing professor. She knows exactly what she\'s doing, she gives good feedback on assignments, she posts all of her powerpoints that we take notes from on Blackboard, and all of her assignments and exams are done online, except for our final project. Easy class, and would definitely take it again!"
"Dr. Jefcoat is a wonderful lady but plays favorites ALL the time....she is helpful, but cannot level with you. She knows too much to understand why you don\'t understand."
Do not take
"This man is adorable. I am actually writing this while looking at him. He gets off track a lot, but I think is it merely that he knows so much and the way he thinks is not the same as the average student. The class is not hard if you write the papers and stay awake. you should really take it. He is hilarious and the class is fun."
Great lectures; obviously loves the subject.
"Greg was always fast to grade my assignments and post them online for me to see. He does great feedback and I\'ve never gotten anything lower than an A-. There were four essays, but they were very easy."
"Judd is the kind of teacher that makes college interesting. If you ever need help, go talk to him. 3 tests are 50-60 Qs, short answer and essay. Previous essays are in his office. Participation and reading are required for the novel, but it\'s a very interesting book. Take good notes; tests are from the lectures. Quizzes require memorizing CA geog."
"I love this class, and this professor is amazing. I recommend!"
"Halfway through the semester he only took up questions in class. However, in the beginning of the semester, his explanations were quite helpful"
"Watt is an unfair professor. He talked badly about one class to another, very unprofessional and rude. He was intimidating and interrupted the women in the class (only) on a regular basis. He knows his stuff, but is unwilling to discuss anything with you unless you agree with him 100%. I did not get very much out of this class."
"I had Blaine for both Info Hell and Grammar and really liked him. I\'ll definitely look to take another class from him. He is sorta hot in a strange, unexplainable way haha!"
"His class was not mandatory but if you missed class, you weren\'t able to turn in your daily classwork which is a huge part of your grade. His test are easy because he goes over test reviews and tells you exactly what is on the tests. The class is easy as most of it is just following what he does on the screen and turning in your class/home work"
"Either read the textbook or listen to Ben\'s lectures, they cover the same material. You\'ll still learn a lot of biology, his segment of the class just wasn\'t very challenging. He writes/finds great labs though."
"I don\'t know what these other people were doing in class, but if you pay attention and ask questions you\'ll be fine. Sure, he gets off topic a lot, but he knows the material backwards and forwards and explains ochem better than I\'ve heard before. Don\'t expect him to be on time, though. Just be patient, he\'s a busy guy, but willing to help."
"I took intermediate web design hoping to improve my skills. I barely learned anything in this joke of a class. This guy just spent the entire class lecturing about god-knows-what, and barely had us do hands-on work. Also, we were forced to take the midterm 3 times because he didn\'t proofread it. The online quizzes were full of mistakes too."
"I\'m not a math person so this class was hard for me. But as the semester went on it got easier. GO TO CLASS. you will not make an A without going to class. She\'s very ""by the book"" and very mono-toned."
Prof. Sesto is kind and funny! his class is straight foward and easy if you do all the work. By work I mean response papers (really easy) and then discuss the readings in class. All the readings are relatively simple and the poems are all simple too.
Not recommended
"Just a great teacher. Takes tons of extra time to help students, and does well at explaining the material. He keeps the class interesting by being friendly, funny, and talkative. While some people may benefit from a more strict teaching style, I liked the fact that we could ask questions easily, talk openly, and work on homework in class."
"Dr. Weeks seems a little stand-offish in class but he\'s a nice guy and he teaches the material really well. I definitely recommend going to office hours because he is much more open to questions involving course work, exams, or content during that time. Overall, was not a bad class"
Great instructor! Very sweet and willing to help!
"Ecology online- poorly structured, assignments did not relate to course, assignments were marked way too hard. This course needs to be re written! 10/10 would NOT take again"
"I only had her for lab, not lecture, so bear that in mind. With that said, she was a very good instructor. Sometimes can be a little confusing in how she explains things, but always helpful with any questions. Very nice too. Her lab wasn\'t too easy or too hard, just right, and she seems to really enjoy teaching the material."
He definitely has an attitude problem and loves to argue...although I must say he\'s and extremely smart man!! He doesn\'t clearly enforce his policies and expects you to read in between the lines- quite intimidating
"he\'s unintentionally the FUNNIEST guy EVER. i mean, come on...DRY GOODS?"
Great class...take it if you can! My ONLY complaint is having spent 100+ on a textbook we did not use...DONT BUY THE BOOK!!!
"Professor Stokes is by far and beyond the best Professor I\'ve had at DCC or ever for that matter. Because of Him I am considering studying abroad in Spain next year.He has taught me to really understand spoken and written spanish and i\'ll be forever grateful to him. He is a fun, energetic,kind hearted wonderful man. Take him, you\'ll never regret it"
"In my opinion, he does not teach well. He is very hesitant when teaching and seems to only know one way of explaining things. I would try to ask him questions and he would leave me more confused than before I asked him anything. It also seems like he expects his students to know a lot of the information beforehand. The exams are very difficult."
Very clear and interesting lectures. Lots of information on test so be prepared to study. Not an easy grader but he is fair. Be sure to attend lecture and really know the material.
"Great teacher. Show up, pay attention, take notes, and study. Do that and youll pass with no problems. Poor reviews come from poor students. Hes knows his stuff and puts extra effort into those he sees are doing the same. Very approachable and helpful outside of class too. Wants you to succeed and provides guidance to those who seek it."
"His tests are hard but it will balance out with the Essays and open book quizzes. Do well on them and you will be fine.I never really showed up 4 class I got more reading on my own. But, he does take of a few points if absent. I was absent about 11 times and still had a good Participation grade. Highly Recommended!"
Amazing professor with a very sincere and big heart. Knows what she\'s talking about and explains things very thoroughly. You can tell she cares about her students and is well respected. Class itself is fun and although there is a heavy workload it\'s worth taking. Try not to miss class and try to participate in class discussions (:
"She spends the entire semester calling on students who are clearing uncomfortable, and do not know the material well enough. She will pick on you throughout the class, never making students who are comfortable answer. Probably the worst teacher I have had at CSN so far. DON\'T TAKE THIS CLASS IF TALKING OUTLOUD AND INFRONT OF CROWDS GIVE YOU ANXIETY"
Dr. Nolasco is a good professor. Her tests are just like the practice exam and she helps if you need it. Good class and would take her again.
"Excellent class, entertaining prof, I learned a lot."
"Mrs.Ross is a very easy teacher. Her Lectures consist of Slides presentation, and She Post EVERYTHING on Blackboard. which is helpful. Her reviews are very broad some of the times. READING is a must in the class."
He is a young and understands the current IT issues.
"Bioethics is a great class; Dr. Creamer is pretty cool. Just make sure to show up for class (attendance is part your grade), take good notes, read the required readings and you should do well on your midterm and final exam."
Absolute worst professor I ever had at the campus. For a lower level course it is ridiculously hard. I was taking the class for a general ed credit and I wound up using a late drop because I was just so frustrated with the way the course was taught and all the work for a class that I didn\'t even need for my major.
Dr. Abel was a great teacher. she is pretty easy when it comes to you only have 3 exams and 3 written installments. The only thing is you MUST ATTEND CLASS. If you don\'t attend and don\'t take notes then good luck. Also you must read the chapters BEFORE coming into class or other wise you won\'t know whats going on. She grades based on your knowledge
fun teacher
"He told us several times it isn\'t his fault if we fail because he doesn\'t know oceanography. I did the review/readings and understood everything he told us we would need and still got under 70 on each test, with the curve. Do not take this class with him. It will kill your GPA unless you spend hours studying the book"
"She was really good, related everything with stories of her own which helped understand the lessons more, her tests are a bit hard but if you study like you would for any other class you will be fine."
"I manage to get an A in this class. He is funny sometimes. Test are okay, just study and you should be okay."
"Tough grader but if you\'re looking for a good foundation be ready to work for it. Utilizes class time well and the 10 minute break helps the class go by a lot faster. Lets you use chapter review for the exams, simply doing the review for practice and using it on the test as a guideline made the biggest difference for me. Doesn\'t curve or round up"
"I actually got angry that I had to take this class. It was totally useless. If you don\'t know the material presented in class, you probably haven\'t taken English. I\'m dumbfounded that this class exists. Mills was also gone a lot and unhelpful. Nothing good to say about this class at all."
"I took this class online and it took getting used to even though I\'ve taken MANY online courses before. The discussion posts due every week are easy. The quizzes, midterm and test however, are not. Sometimes answers would be wrong online and my grade dropped from an A- to a B after a blackboard malfunction which she refused to help and was rude"
This professor expects a lot of respect from students while not giving much respect in return. Cynical to the degree that it demotivates you to even feel interested in the material.
Professor is interesting but exams are very difficult and there is too much material to learn
"I had him my freshman year for both economics and seminar. Although I hated my morning economics class, Professor Condon made it fun and easy! He will always try to make you laugh all while showing he is very serious in what he teaches. I recommend you take economics with him or any other class he teaches!!"
"Lisa was my instructor for 1108 and Literature. If you\'re able to have her for an instructor, consider yourself lucky. If she taught other courses I needed to take, I would do what I could to have her as my instructor again."
"Pretty easy class. As long as you get the main idea of the readings you\'ll be fine. May seem hard at first but it\'s not that bad. He is a lenient grader on essay questions, but be sure to do well on tests because he doesn\'t have any other written assignments other than DB. I didn\'t have to put much time in this course to get an A."
"Good teacher, class didn\'t seem too difficult and the books were cheap. He can be a bit slow going but you should be able to do well if you understand the homework."
"Mr. K is an awesome teacher! He cares a lot about his students, and he does care if they come to class or not. I highly recommend him. You will go from being an accidental writer, to a real writer. I wish he would teach English 103, but I am happy I had the opportunity to take his 101 class."
"Chamberlain is not a bad teacher, not an amazing teacher. His lectures are actually helpful if you are caught up on homework and take good notes. If you are confused though, I recommend just going to the tutor center or his office hours for extra help."
Lack of ambition and there no real need to show up to class.. I taught myself more about Funeral Service law then he taught me.. And its impossible not to get an A in this class.. Wheres the challenge?
Mr. Siskind is the only teacher I had that ever tought actually how to PRACTICE aural skills. He is very helpful and knowledgeable and is motivating for students who are struggling. Every teacher should strive to be as effective as he is.
"Took Dr. P. for the mandatory geography class which I was dreading, but he actually made it both interesting and exciting!"
She loves what she teaches! Is pretty engaging. Classes are very easy if you listen in lecture and look through notes.
"DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS IF YOU AREN\'T A FILM MAJOR. I took this class as part of my global education requirement, and hated every second of it. There is no leniency on those who aren\'t versed in film critiquing and no explanation of what kind of critiquing she wants you to do. she chastises people for not participating and doesn\'t help you."
"Finally a teacher who comes here to teach, no bull. Yes, he\'s a bit dry, and his handwriting is an issue, but I would take him any day over these facile teachers who make you feel like you\'re in kindergarten. (and if you\'re a bit bored ask him about 70\'s rock shows)"
"This class with Professor white is interesting, however the assignments in this class are not easy, you have to apply what you learned in the previous RWS classes taken. Her assignments are a bit confusing, so ask questions if something is not clear for you. Overall she is great teacher and is available after class for students, work hard"
"Do yourself a favor and ignore all of the negative reviews. I almost didn\'t take her class because of this site but I\'m so glad I did. Professor Srinivas is friendly, humorous, straightforward, generous with grading, and offers a ton of extra credit. Show up to class, pay attention to the lectures/films, do the readings, and you should be fine."
really interesting lectures but she is not great at leading at discussions. she is very helpful though.
"Professor Whitten is an amazing professor. He gives you everything you need to be successful and it\'s really up to you if you pass or not. However, he does make you work for it, but if you prepare it isn\'t too bad. Overall, would recommend because it was genuinely a great professor and person."
"The class is easy and has a light course load, its just that the prof is a bit rude to students. Very nice in class and lecture style is decent, didnt strike and used humour enough to keep my attention at least. Short answer is easy on exams, multiple choice is tough."
THe Best
This professor is tough. The class is NOT the easiest one i\'ve taken. I understood the lectures and the quizzes but when it comes the exams they are really hard. 1 exam you can take at home with a time limit but the math questions are really hard and then the final exam you have to take it at school with him. Do the EXTRA CREDIT assignments!!!
"Everything Dr. Hanson did in class was meticulous accurate very thorough. His attention to detail made it easy for us students to be held to the same standard. If I could choose one professor to teach all my classes, it would be him. His homework assignments take around 6 hours on average to complete well. He also wrote the textbook we used."
"He is an amazing professor. Learned a lot from him. His philosophys in acting is interesting and also work. He is always willing to help people, and for those who are not as good in acting will immedatly get what he is teaching. The choice of plays are awsome to read. Immediatly recommend him."
"She just read off of the slides everyday. Tests were pretty easy, but the movie writing assn. was graded really weird and she was unclear about it, so everyone got low grades and it does affect your overall grade."
"He\'s a cool guy, discussions in class were interesting, but the subject matter is way less interesting than you\'d think it would be. He\'s also a very tough grader, but he does not fail you if you turn work in. Sometimes the quizzes were tricky. Not a blowoff class, though it\'s almost presented that way."
"I really love Mrs. Dickson. She was so helpful and really explains things in details. She doesn\'t like to repeat herself but as long as you pay attention and do your work, you will get along with her."
"She is SO nice and has very interesting lectures. If you study your notes, you will get an A in this class. Her tests are very easy and mostly short answers and essays. She had an extra credit project too. Be careful with the paper you have to write on a historical person... she grades it for gramar and sentence structure as well as content."
"very informative and to the point, direct and helpful in answering questions. Overall great professor. if you do the work and keep up on readings everything goes from there. no fluff to have to deal with, she only gives the things you need to know and it directly relates to the topic at hand."
"Dr. Yang was one of the best professors I""ve ever had. I had her 20+ years ago. I went on to get a doctorate in psychology in large part because of her. She is an awesome prof. Count yourself lucky if you\'ve ever had her. I do."
"Not so great. Boring powerpoint presentations in class. Too much focus on Android. His explanations are catered towards recordings, so they sound good, but are not very clear in class. Quizzes every week that ask questions lifted directly from the lecture notes. Trivial and confusing questions. Also, programming assignments have terrible guides."
Loves to humiliate her students.
Mr. Gobrogge!!!! When are you coming back to teach at FSU???? Psychology misses you!
"Hes one of the best physics professors in ccny . Take him ! You wont regret it at all ! & Like everyone said, his curve is insane !!"
After only having this teacher for 4 classes i can already tell we will but heads. she is very condescending and if you don\'t have an opinion that she deems right then you mine as well should have called her the c word. worse than my sociology teacher who had an academic hearing. don\'t take this teacher.
"She is awesome if you read and pay attention. Shes very funny and reasonable but strict. Her tests are extremely hard, but a piece of cake if you study!"
Great Course Great Prof! A must if you work with kids with EBD/DD
"Mendle is a history major\'s dream professor. Once you get past his loud (sometimes annoying) lecture style, he\'s hilarious and full of knowledge about random British crap. He\'s from New York which probably explains the people who said he\'s rude... he is very sarcastic and blunt. His classes always fill up fast because he\'s just that awesome."
She\'s great!!! I had a lot of fun. She is always helpful. Take this class!!!!
"His tests and homework do not reflect what\'s in his unavoidable long-winded and disjointed lectures. If you\'re a theatre major you have to take this course anyway, so bring your laptop and don\'t let him see you\'re really on facebook the whole time. Good luck to you."
"Do not recommend. Her lecture moves at a snail\'s pace and barely covers any of the material actually on the exams. She doesn\'t announce exams (including finals) until the prior class, and then her descriptions are so vague that it\'s a total crapshoot as to what will be on them. Exams and quizzes cover obscure details rather than important concepts."
HORRIBLE!!! Stay far away. This professor doesn\'t know how to teach. Already assumes you know the language completely. She is way to spanish speaking native to actually teach people. Worst class i\'ve ever taken.
Very good professor...if you are willing to put in the effort. Some have pointed that she rates according to her French level. What do you expect? Writing bad French sentences and get good grades?
She has ntohing going for her except sex appeal.
"This was a semi-easy A, however I would not recommend this course. It was a 5 week online course and not only was there a RIDICULOUS amount of reading, the due dates for the assignment were constantly changing or unclear and often times quizzes were given late or due dates extended. It was a mess and confusing to keep track of."
"A hard gen. ed, unless you\'re creative this class will be difficult. I was in the honors section so garber was my T.A. Shes a super nice person. But its hard for a Gen Ed."
"She\'s nice. To pass the class, learn all of the concepts and become familiar with each market that she discusses. Read the book a couple of times, do the HW, take detailed notes, and you\'ll be fine. If you go to class, she may surprise you with a quiz that can get 1 point added to your final grade. Study HW questions; they may appear in exams."
"If you are taking any math class, take hers. A very very nice person. High level math classes at Baruch are not easy, she explains slowly to make you easier to understand. Not much HW, relax class but you learn stuff. No matter what class you take with her, mainly focus on the review sheets before exams, they are very similar."
stay away from this guy he might think he funny with he is fake laugh hell to the no. not recommended.
I cannot exaggerate enough what an AMAZING & INSPIRATIONAL professor she is. I absolutely love her & would take her for every course if I could. She\'s so helpful & passionate & wants nothing more than for you to understand the material.
Dr. C is excellent! Really helped me to appreciate science fiction. Loved the readings. Class was very exciting; I liked her enthusiasm.
"Very good profesor,and makes the material really fun!"
"The class consists of 5 unit exams and 4 quizzes. He drops the lowest grade for each one and gave one extra credit assignment. You earn lab points for showing up, but he doesn\'t teach anything. You\'re pretty much on your own. His lectures consists of him reading the lecture notes from the power points. Be ready to do a lot of reading and studying."
"The language was definitely an issue, and he often misunderstood questions that were asked of him, which meant he didn\'t really answer it. However, he was super helpful and always willing to give an extension on projects if asked."
"Nice guy. I feel like he gave up part of the way through the semester. To be fair it was a summer session, but by the second to last class the lecture became so dry it felt like I had just tried swallowing pure cinnamon, but in my brain."
"He is a great professor, he made me enjoy and learn History. works with you so you can pass the class and very understanding. show up in class and do your Quizzes, Test, and assignments which by the way a very easy if you take notes, and you will get an A."
whats up!
A great prof! Super knowledgeable and you can tell she wants her students to succeed. She talks fast but is really funny. She appreciates participation and will give marks for it. I will definitely take another one of her classes.
"ENERGETIC, Full of life. She really does an amazing job as teaching the class by using different Methods. The work load is fair and sqaure and fun to learn. She really gets your mind thinking."
great professor!
"Outstanding teacher & expert pianist, neither rude nor mean. Defines musical terms clearly, shows them with piano if needed. Plays CDs, points out music structure. Three short quizzes. Extra points for prompt reports on local musical performances. I strongly recommend him for those who want to learn more about classical music."
"He is fair. Definately has favourites so get on his good side by paying attention and making intelligent observations. If you ask dumb questions you will get dumb answers. He\'s a good guy I got A\'s in 289, 344, 387 plus senior proj. by paying attention"
She is very boring but her class is straight to the point. The test include all the information we have discussed in class. Her classes are just going over the stories and then answering the questions and doing vocab.
"Dr. Wright is awesome. He will push back a exam if the whole class doesn\'t think they are ready. Generally he doesn\'t ""Grade"" the homework, he does give you full credit if you at least tried. Whatever you do don\'t anger him, he is incredibly scary when you anger him."
He is super easy going. You dont have to attend classes till the test day. He lets you fix your tests as long as you do your homework and tests online
"Easy and interesting class. I didn\'t study for one exam and am going to get an A or A+. Literally do the readings(I did them but you probably don\'t even have to do those), watch the movies, and pay attention in lecture (which shouldn\'t be hard because she is a great lecturer) you\'ll get an A no problem. A really fun class that covers 2 GenEd Reqs."
Very Interesting Class! You will love REV!
"Dr. Dunn was pretty awesome. I hated every single moment of chemistry, but the only reasons I pulled out the A were because of his helpfulness and his willingness to give the class a generous curve when we needed it the most. Great guy, all around."
Do not take this professor if you do not have to. He grades very harshly and does not upload grades on blackboard. So you may actually be failing and wouldn\'t even know it. He also talks very low and monotone; so good luck with not falling asleep! This class is a lot of busy work as well; which I thought to be uncalled for.
"I had zero confidence in my Spanish skills when I started this class, but once I got Prof. K. as my instructor, all that changed. He really helped to see that I was not horrible with the language and that I could do it. I feel completely different about Spanish now and I think might even minor in it. Gracias Prof. K."
Amazing.
"Great teacher. Good understanding of material, pleasant personality and very supportive of your ideas. Answers every and all questions. Alot of fun aswell. Totally recommend her. Plus very easy...mostly due to her teaching."
"She can be a great teacher, but attach student verbally."
"nice guy, rambles a lot. gives pop quizzes instead of tests. just the final. he puts hw on angel and the answers. hes not too bad to pass but hard to understand materials"
Great Piano teacher. Wished her schedules would be in the mornings or afternoons.
she is a very hard teacher. she does not take time to answer questions. out of all of the science prof. she goes the fastest and when the class asked her to slow down or go more in depth she said no and to read the text. do urself a favor and do Not get her!
"I loved biology in high school, but taking this class ruined it for me. Dr. Stover really doesn\'t know what he\'s talking about. You will do fine on the exams if you study exactly what the slides say; you do not need a book. Be sure to answer the questions in the back of the powerpoint. He asks weirdly-phrased questions on the exam."
"Not a nice person. Not interested in her students\' opinions. Cuts you off when you are sharing your thoughts with the class. Horrible. I did not enjoy the class and she is an unrealistic grader. She literally asks the class for its opinions, calls on someone, then begins sharing her own opinion before the person is finished. Avoid her if you can."
"I had Tom Solon for 5 classes. He\'s a great guy (and pretty funny too). Even though his classes are pretty easy, I learned a lot from them. If nothing else, you should take his classes for the entertainment value (he\'s hilarious)."
"A wonderful teacher simply because he enjoys the topic and enjoys helping the students learn it. Granted, his accent and writing abilites could use some work; don\'t let it discourage you. He is knowledgable and very considerate/fair on tests. No tricks. I\'m glad I took the class! Positive experience"
"Also took him for Principles of Management. His tests are usually easy and consist mostly of True & False, but I didn\'t enjoy taking either class. I found him to be very boring and he talked mostly about his life experiences and other tangent things rather than about the subject matter."
If you are horrible at english i do not recommend taking this class. She is a very strict teacher and wants everything the exact way she wants it. She is a very hard teacher to please! I hated the class and had to withdrawal half way through.
"seems like a nice lady, confusing class extremely annoying voice"
"This class had very interesting discussions and offers great insight. There are two presentations, one paper, a bunch of quizzes, and 2 exams and a final. The exams were pretty tough, must refer to readings. And the quizzes were all true and false based. Funny personality, class is definitely not boring, might take again."
Dr. Noha is great! Gives a lot of HW and a couple quizzes. Majority of grade is from activities done with another student and blog posts. Doesnt grade hard on tests/Quizzes. Definitely recommend taking her if you are interested in learning Arabic! :)
"Gives lots of notes taken from the texts which bring about dialogue in class. The discussion is what makes this class interesting, and the ability to learn is fantastic! Danette is very knowledgeable in the material she is teaching and can guide students to sources and resources. It\'s important to keep up to the readings, or you will be lost!"
"Prof. Smith is nice, but starts lecturing out of the book, then starts talking about her own life..never stays on key..always behind on chapters, and forgets to grade our papers on time or leaves them at home..talks quietly,brings her young son to class everyday...class is quite a challenge."
annouce when collecting HW and when we\'re having a quiz.
Durkin was bound to be an awesome Professor! He is fabulous & perfect in every single way!
"Great teacher and great class. Open book tests. As long as u pretend ur paying attention, u can do what u want. He advised me to take this class, as it would be an easy A. It was just that!"
Hicks is a great teacher! Everything about his class is awesome even if you aren\'t good at math! He explains everything perfectly! I recommend that you take him
"took him a couple of times. just write down all his notes, and memorize them. His exams are basically re-writing all the notes word by word. you learn alot, and theirs no trick to his exams. just memorize. it can be alot but as long as u memorize its easy. I got As everytime i took him. classes are mostly interesting, hes a fun guy"
She was a wonderful teacher. I was bored at times but she explains everything very clearly and is very understanding. She grades very fairly and is always available when you need her. I recommend taking her she is very insightful.
"Great classes, actually makes them interesting and applicable to other areas of law. Incredibly willing to work with classes/individual students on areas with which they\'re struggling. Overall a great prof, and a great guy who genuinely cares about his students."
Great professor! His class is easy and he makes it very interesting! Easy A!
Ochs is hysterical!! You must go to EVERY class in order to understand the material because the text book absolutely SUCKS!!! But he does care about the course even though he taught once in a beer t-shirt. i loved the class.
"You can definitely tell the Dr. Glaze LOVES what he is teaching, and it\'s nice for the professor to have a passion for his subject. Only thing that I think could improve the class would be to take it over the summer (a shorter term), because about halfway through you start seeing the same notes over and over again. Overall, fun class."
"She did not teach, you just got a few assignments here and there"
"Covers variety of topics compared to other professors that help to get a general understanding. Assignments and project were helpful to learn R, as it was not much covered in the class. Mail communications were helpful."
DIFFICULT GRADER.. maybe things changed over the last couple years. had her for a 3 hr class but let us out everytime in 1.5 hrs. doesnt take attendence but to keep up and fully understand you need to attend class. quiz every class.
very stubborn - it is his way or forget it. He does know what he is doing though and tries to make geometry as fun as it can be.
The tests are pretty hard. I made a 82 and I studied my ass of. She covers most of the material in class but it\'s extremely hard to stay awake. Most students either struggle to stay awake or surf the internet. I would avoid this teacher.
"Daniel is a good guy and really cares about his students. The assignments are hard, but they really help you apply the stats instead of just learning the concepts. Come to him with questions about the homework early and he will help! Tests are easy if you go to class and open note."
"Lots of reading and reading quizzes, but is very lenient in grading. Very little writing compared to other HH104 profs. Very laid back."
She super nice your not required to come to class but if you do come she will let you drop you lowest exam grade there is no homework and we do a lot of activities so you dont just sit around and take note also you watch some movies most of them were pretty good but im actually taking another class from her cause shes so cool
"Teacher is very passionate, but very hard to understand during lectures. Attendance is a MUST if you want to pass."
I had Andrea in spring \'04 for Sex and Society. She was a fantastic instructor. I enjoyed the class and learned a lot. Discussions were always lively and interesting. Andrea\'s non-judgmental nature made entering class discussions easy and non-threatening. I highly recommend taking any course she is teaching.
"Good Professor, made class interesting."
You do a lot of online work for this class even though it\'s in the classroom. The program stinks and has lots of glitches. Mr. Johnson was very easy to talk to and helped sort out the problems.
Nicest guy in the world...really cares about his students and if you understand the work or not. He will help u in any way he can no matter what. News quizes sucked but count as nothing. Hes a young guy and remembers what its like to be in college. I would definitly recommend this professor to everyone!
She is very nice and helpful. Weird sense of humor kind of. Very well educated and actually tells you what she\'ll look for in your essay and will go over your drafts for you.
"Anne rocks. She is one of the best professors in the department, as well as a genuinely nice person. The people who don\'t like her are stupid and can\'t spell."
"Highly recommended, very helpful. Enjoyable class."
HE\'S AWESOME! HE\'S THE ONLY ENGLISH TEACHER I\'VE HAD IN MY COLLEGE CAREER WORTHY OF HIS PROFESSION. DOES NOT HAVE A GOD COMPLEX LIKE EVERY OTHER RETARDED ENGLISH TEACHER AT THE LANCER COMM. COLLEGE
"Professor Chute has been such a great instructor throughout AP 1 and 2. The classes are tough, reading at home is a must! It is very possible to get an A if you really commit to studying hard. She is more than willing to answer any questions and is always available before and after class. Take her class, you won\'t regret it!!"
"In terms of how heavy the content of the material that is studied, I was fairly unimpressed with Dr. Lundervold\'s lack of presence/enthusiasm in the classroom. The main reason I passed this class was because I actually found the material interesting (many did not). You CAN pass 2130 but you must read your book very diligently. Quizzes twice a week."
"tries way to hard on the first day. acts like he chill about the assignments since its a condense course but in reality the assignments are doubled. Hes rude and blames everything on the students as if we\'re the reason his class sucks. Starts class way to early, like before time is suppose to so you hear the same speech over and over. awful class."
"seems intimidating but isn\'t. +/- grading. a 95% is an A. a 90% is a B. Attend class, especially discussion, even after the midterm (optional attendance). The tests are hard, the papers are easy as long as you follow what he wants. Answer the questions, define the vocab, and TYPE the quotes for each author. That is 80% of the midterm/final."
"I took the CO-OP class at the Stafford campus and its ALOT of work but the professor is very helpful and knowledgeable to help, if you stay on task and discipline yourself its an easy A. Will be taken second course with him this semester."
this class was the first I had taken since returning to college after 15 years and it was the best experience - Professor Chaaban is very intelligent and makes class interesting. He brings in speakers to talk about specific religions. I would highly recommend his class to anyone needing a humanities class.
Tells it like it is. Not afraid to give us the grade we deserve. Gets riled up too easily.
"Phong is extremely entertaining. He comes to class everyday with a story and it always ties into the lesson. He provides crystal clear examples for problems. His class is absolutely brilliant. People line up outside the door 15 minutes before class starts, consistently."
Love her!
"I loved this class with Dr. Grubbs, but I did not like her tests and quizzes. The quizzes were unpredictable and the tests were hard. Dr. Grubbs tries very hard to make the class enjoyable through hands on activities. She would bring in exotic fruits for us to taste, so that we knew what she was talking about in class. This class was a lot of fun!"
this woman is a horrible teacher. you could take this course online. she tells you the assignment topic and then puts you in peer editing groups and doesnt even want to see your papers until the preliminary grading. passing the portfolio is all on you guys. want a teachers help... dont sign up for her class
Lack of versatility in teaching style limits his success with students. More interested in having his students be with his family than seeing them become individuals.
This is a useless class being managed by a useless person. I thought a grad class is better than this?
"Fun and easy class. Professor Trecka is really easy going and awkward in a funny way. Lets you retake any quiz, always accepts late work and the final is open note. The class is very easy and fun, all you do is watch clips the whole class. Loved this professor, loved this class."
"Dr. Krufka is an outstanding professor. Her lectures are minimal, and you have to read the book, but the discussions in class are very thorough. She\'s very helpful in the labs and the group project. Developmental bio is the hardest class I\'ve ever taken but it was very interesting and Dr. Krufka made it bearable. Would take a class with her again."
"I think this professor really wants you to learn and is wiling to help and explain things in detail. Allot of work and its challenging but if you don\'t get 100 percent which you won\'t, a detailed explanation of why is given for you to understand for future use. Definitely one of the best professors in ISOM department. Also a fair grader."
MISERABLE CLASS! He doesn\'t use the computer at all so don\'t expect a power point. He talks for the whole entire 1.5 hours. You just take notes the entire class and you better not miss anything. Doesn\'t review for anything. Your notes are what get you through this class. Only used the book about 2 times.
"This class was like a carpet being pulled out from under you and turned into a magic carpet. I never really knew where we were going until the class was over. Then all these threads came together-- . But I realized, not all threads ever come together and that the missing pieces are where the light comes in. I 100% recommend professor Franceschini!"
"Good professor, the only complain I have was that the quizzes were a lot easier than the exams. The exams are a lot harder, but with a tutor/office hours the class is manageable"
"the lectures are completely incoherent. he doesn\'t take tme to explain things and expects you to know so much. highly disorganized and the test was atrocious. it was nothing we went through in detail in the class, and so hard!"
"She sucks at explaining things and makes them way harder than necessary. I took calc in high school and felt awful for anyone having to learn from her for the first time. If you know what you\'re doing, it\'s an easy A."
A very good teacher. I was not excited about taking the course but then it turned out to be one of my most interesting classes. The class is hard only because of the subject matter but Professor Geier makes it as straight forward as possible.
"Took finance class the term before prior to this class with Prof Stieven, loved it & subject of finance. Took 5880 w/Greenburg & made me completely hate finance. Jumps around, tests do not relate to homework given or topics discussed in class. Basically had to teach myself. Had an A in every class in MBA program except his which I received a C."
Even though it\'s English 1A this is a great class with a great teacher who really know her stuff. She will teach you how to write an essay and her method actually works. Highly recommend.
Hands down Mrs Newmar is the best teacher in all of Rockland Community College. Mrs Newmark should be the Computer Studies advisor rather than Mrs Sinowitz. I advise everyone to take whatever classes you can with her because you will gain great knowledge!
"Westrope led a tough class. His prompts were often unclear, but if you asked him for help he would explain until it was understood. The topics to write on were often difficult, but I enjoyed his personality. If you must take a difficult class it is better to have a helpful teacher than an easy one, I suppose."
Very unorganized.
Easy Class. Easy A. You have to take her and it is impossible to fail the online course. Very easy..
I ENJOY CLASS. HE MAKES CLASS FUN AND ENTERTAINING.
"Dr. Hettes is funny, interesting and down to Earth. She makes sure you know the material instead of memorizing it."
"an excellent instructor. teaches very clearly, communicates well, has very good assignments that will most likely end up in your porfolio. cares about the students success and is does not sugar coat the criticism. smart guy that is an asset to the department."
"He was awful teacher. He was never helpful. He never wanted to do anything for me. He sat around and was only help to the students, he liked."
Avoid taking his class... Tough grader and gives you no real feedback to do better. Attendance is the bulk of your grade.
He is all over the place with his lectures.He gives study guides for the test but the answers to the questions are broad.I made a B in his class but I recorded every lecture as he doesn\'t use the book except for when teaching the constitution and I studied for about 3 days straight before a test.There is no homework only 4 tests.Do not take him.
"My very first teacher at Meredith. Made me feel welcome and like part of the class, unlike previous teachers from other colleges. I really enjoyed the class. I learned a lot about tennis and can finally play a decent game. Thanks!"
"I had Nancy for 3 classes. I made a B in each of them, but I missed class a lot. I was sick and had personal problems. She helped me get through the class. I learned a lot too. She gives background information for each historical period and tells us how the history relates to today. I think she is good. I would take her again."
Very boring. Please avoid taking his class.
"Her class is one of my favorites!! She is a great teacher for people who learn best from discussion. She picks really interesting articles and books to read. You won\'t get bored in the lectures because she is always wanting feedback, not to just talk at you. Highly recommended."
Very difficult class but also very interesting. Locay is one of the smartest people ive ever met.
Amazing professor. Itec 1620 programming was a HARD course but prof made it interesting. Tests are challenging. He\'s not a boring lecturer like other profs. Awesome personality and COOL prof! Definitely recommend!
Greatest professor of all time. end of story.
"Ver, Very good teacher...not easy...you have to study to keep up...wants her students to succeeed."
NO BOOK!!! Gives out random 5 pt quizzes
"Professor DiGiacomo, is a very active and hands on in all courses and it doesn\'t matter if your an online student or on campus. Her skills as a teacher is impeccable and her accolades is the proof In the pudding!!!"
It would be nice to be given a review for a test.
"i loved this class and professor just!! it was the only class i looked forward to because she was such a wonderful teacher! very flexible, laid back, and helpful! she was so great i\'m taking a class by her again"
"Great/patient teacher! I took her Tuesday 5:30 class, so she did reviews right before the test, which was amazing! You still need to study, but it\'s not a hard class. She listens to and answers all questions. She really wants each student to pass!"
"shes a sweet lady, but shes very direct. be nice to her and she will be nice to you."
GOOD RIDDANCE Dr. Dave. He is by far the most arrogant professor I\'ve ever had. The sad thing is that he\'s SO incredibly talented. Just thinking about my time rehearsing with him makes me cringe. Dave you are the sole reason that I burned out of music. I have no idea what kind of Kool-Aid you give your students at THS but it didn\'t work over here.
"horrible teacher, dont ever take for public speaking!!! worst class ever, pathetic teacher who thinks that she is awesome. her only real talent is that she could fill in for shamu at sea world when he is sick. but seriously dont take this class, you will be sorry."
I recommend her for anyone she\'s amazing. Homework every night but its not tough if you pay attention in class.
Understand the chapter ahead of her teaching that chapter in class. The lecture is real minimal.
"She is one of the best teachers I have ever had. She is not only kind, but also understanding. She is willing to help you if you let her know. Great and amazing teacher."
"You will be quizzed frequently, and do a semester project( paper on geographic phenomenem). Test are challenging, and he splits them 50/5o multiple choice, short answer. Good overall experience. Though"
"he was one of my best instructor to learn english as a secondary language. i loved, how he taught us, grammar, writing, however not much reading."
"She is a very sweet women and she\'s also very helpful. She wants her students to do well so badly and she tries her hardest to help them. If you someone who is helpful and kind, than Miss Jackson is your gal."
"FANTASTIC PROFESSOR! He only teaches the second half of the course, but my grade skyrocketed on the last 2 tests. He\'s interesting to listen to and really has a passion for bio. Dr.Ruben keeps the class engaged and tells you exactly what you need to know for the exam. He annotates his lectures as he goes, which is really helpful! Such a great guy!"
weird guy
"Professor Gigliotti is one of the most inspirational professors that I have ever had. She makes sure you are learning the necessary information in order to do well on the exams. Not only are you going to learn while taking this class, but you will enjoy every minute of it! She makes attending class an enjoyable thing. DEFINITELY TAKE HER!"
Great professor. Knows what he is talking about and always keeps you interested in subject. I think he is professional and good at communicating with students.I have taken him for three different cources and all three have been a great expirence.
"Classes were often boring. Had to sit closer to hear him. His lectures were sometimes interesting, but I only kept notes for his ""drop quizzes"". The tests are based on the text book though. So the difficulty of the class really depends on the TAs."
"Very nice teacher, extremely helpful if you visit her for help on a paper or anything, but grading may be less than expected"
"The class overall wasn\'t horrible. The worst part was probably actually GOING to class. The lectures are really long and the movies selection isn\'t the greatest. Most of the movies are 80\'s or older. The class goes over politics, racism, class, and gender inequality. If you sign up for this class try to be objective and don\'t take things personally"
"The homework and quizes are online through mymathlab, except the midterm and final. She is always full of energy and excited to teach. Her class is lecture heavy and you will become confused if you miss class. She is a great professor and she grades fairly. Tip: If you show up to class and do the homework it will be an easy A. I enjoyed the class."
"took this class in the fall and had to retake it for more understanding... hes an awesome guy just getting old.. nothing was manditory but tests and quizs\'... if u didnt do the hw on ur own, and all of it, u didnt really learn much... suggestion: do alot of hw on ur own..."
"Not only does he offers good critic, he can tell stories and funny lies to play with your head. He\'s amazing!"
i only had a couple of tutorials with him so far but he is definetly the most interesting prof i have & makes the class enjoyable to be in!!!
GREAT prof :-) extremely helpful and nice
Awesome professor! Even though the class is hard she try her best to make sure you understand it. She will go out of her way to help you with a problem. She makes sure that you are well prepared but you have to put in A LOT of time and effort. I would definitely take another class of hers!
"The worst teacher I have ever had! Can\'t understand him and did not accurately keep up with our grades. If you have a choice, take another teacher for econ."
very nice and easy.
She\'s a great proffessor and very helpful and really knows alot. I would recommend you take her if your interested in learning about Smalll group communication.
i think he\'s not that good....
"She\'s the best professor for Draping, Textile and evrything she teachs. She\'s really good and waht she does."
"He\'s probably the nicest professor in the world, which is great because he\'s also really clear in his expectations, in lecture, in his comments. He\'s very helpful, his lectures are always straightforward and on topic, and he\'s a very fair grader. Perhaps even overly fair, with an extra credit question on every exam. So basically: favorite professor"
"Amazing! I miss his class, he is engaging and funny. Participation is important but if you prove early on that you\'re on top of your workreadings he won\'t call on you as much. I wish I could take his class again. Not like regular arhs classes, he uses multimedia presentations and teaches for visual learners. HES THE BEST!"
She is awful. DO NIT TAKE THIS CLASS!! She never hands back assignments in time and when she does there has never been a grade on it. She is more concerned with her family life and should be a full time mother.
"Extremely dull lectures. Not clear of what is expected in course. Definitely made my interest in politics less, even though he is so passionate about following them....."
She\'s an incredibly nice teacher and tries to help you with whatever problems you might be having but her teaching methods aren\'t the best (material is straight from the book alone). She\'s one of the best calc teachers at NJIT though and even tries to help you during the exams which is a big plus. Got a B for the class but would take her again.
"Gary is an awesome teacher! Definitely one of my favorites. He really cares about his students and the subjects he teaches. Read the assignments because there are often daily 10pt quizzes, two midterms that are easy if you study, and no final! Also the mock trial is super fun. Overall great class and teacher."
"Not extremely hard, but she teaches from the powerpoints. Didn\'t seem very knowledgeable about the subject she was teaching. Was pretty nice. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS AT EIGHT. You will either fall asleep or not go, and her attendance policy is counted into the grades, so it\'s not good to miss class. Several writing assignments and five quizzes."
"This is an extremely difficult class. You HAVE to know everything that was covered in the prerequisites (ACCT 2102, ACCT 2102, Micro & Macro Economics, Business Statistics) because he is going to reference them a lot. If you want to pass, have to spend hours putting in the work to study and TALK to him. He will help if he knows you are trying."
Prof. Chiappa was very helpful and accommodating. Would definitely take classes with him again!
She\'s hard to please
"A lot of reading, tons of fun videos, great class discussion forums. This is one of my fave classes."
"He\'s a dry lecturer, but a nice guy overall, and very willing to help and talk. If you have essays/writing assignments, you\'re set, since he\'s not a very hard grader. He assigns a reasonably large amount of reading, but if you use his class notes and just skim the assigned readings, it won\'t be too difficult to do well."
"This was the hardest class I took this past fall semester. There is a humongous amount of info to know - mainly what he covers in lecture, but also stuff he assigns on the textbook. On top of all, the exams are very harsh even though they are multiple choice."
"Easy, no ""fluff"" or B.S. LEAD class. Very smart guy. Classes consist of discussing current events and other topics. He likes you to contribute but its very easy to sit back and listen. You have one paper at the end on anything you like, and two little in-class papers. There\'s no book, but his mind is an amazing resource in itself."
this professor gives tons and tons and tons of busywork
"Heather is terrible, she should not be teaching. She is incredibly boring put many students to sleep. Students would be on their phones the whole time in class or on the laptops playing games. She never went into depth in anything, she would tell us to do something and not tell us how to do it."
"Going into this class with the mindset that it would be an easy A was a big mistake. The first test is very easy, mostly regurgitation, but after that, the exams become all application, which is confusing if you adjust your learning style to be for regurgitation exams. He literally only reads off the slides, which he hasn\'t updated in over a year.."
Her class was poorly organized and structured.She does not teach. the class is based on disscussion/debate from assigned readings.Every week an essay is due based on the reading materials.No exams and huge research paper at the end of the semester.
A very cool lady
"Great professor to teach a required basic class. Teaches it like a high school class, which is great. 2 tests and a cumulative final, and he drops the lowest grade. Optional HW for extra credit. If you hate math, and/or need an easy A, TAKE HIM!"
"This teacher is really easy as long as you attend class, and do the little work that is assigned"
prtetty easy teacher!
"I definitely did gain some helpful information from taking this class. It was also ridiculously easy, and there is no reason anyone cannot make an A in her class. A somewhat strict attendance policy, but try not to be late often or miss many days and she\'ll be cool to you."
I took both cell biology and genetics in the summer. He gives up to 40 points extra credit for each class and the summer classes do not have a comprehensive final. If you can find previous tests the exams are very similar. He is very helpful and an all around great guy.
"Can anyone say tenure? He needs to retire and stop wasting the money of serious students who actually want to learn about the subject he is supposed to be teaching. He gave the exact same lecture, word for word, 3 weeks in a row. His final was a duplicate of the midterm."
poor
"Her online Sociology class is extremely reasonable if you follow directions perfectly. If you do not do what she says, you will get a bad grade. Assignments are mostly just discussion boards and she will give you full credit as long as you follow directions and post multiple times. Tests do require preparation as they are timed. Very nice lady!"
Very disorganized. His lecture notes are rambling and out of sequence. His frequent political commentary is out of place and annoying to those who do not share his views and are unwelcome to debate his.
"Class was easy and interesting. The comments about her being biased are true to a certain degree. It is very obvious what her political views are even though she doesn\'t express them explicitly. But honestly, how can you teach a class on the middle east without blaming foreign powers to a certain degree? Has a true passion and love for the topic!"
She is really great! I enjoyed her class! Tests are so easy because they are mainly on slides of art! Just pay close attention and you will do just fine! Also attendance is very important! She pays close attention to that and also make sure you are on time! I loved her! I am also taking her again! DON\'T PASS HER UP!
"If you have prior knowledge of calc like from AP, you\'ll be fine. If you don\'t then this class will be a lot of work. I got an A in the class, just do the homework and make use of your TA\'s hours. Don\'t loose points for stupid things like attendance and homework!"
"Don\'t take him if you get the chance. First expect to memorize tons of slides then guessing which ones are going to be on the tests. The tests are very hard and random and he doesn\'t give any helpful reviews. His lectures are all in a monotone, so easy to fall asleep. Most ppl dropped the course after halfway only 2 out of 24 ppl were making an A!"
"I had Ethics w/ this prof. Let me tell you, it is a HARD class, and it is not what you expect from the course description (more about actual theories in phil. than about moral problems). If, at all possible, do NOT take a class of his. It will sink your grades into the depths."
"Felisha is super awesome and although I can understand why people think she\'s rude, I just think she\'s trying to get things done, you know? She was very respectful any time that I ever interacted with her and I learned SO MUCH from this yoga class! I am a healthier person because of this class! Would recommend 10am cause it starts your day right!"
"Dr. Fedorov is a sweetheart, and is always accessible when you need him and will help you. He teaches well but has a very strong Russian accent and can be somewhat disorganized. Know that Calc 2 is a beast of a course, and you WILL need to put work into it. His tests are not easy, but they are very fair. Personally, I really liked him as a prof.!"
"Took his american lit class... i usually do sodoku during his class. very boring class, but time usually goes fast. if u try to force yourself to feel interested its not so bad. easy A, becasue he doesn\'t take attendance and grades you on only 3 papers."
"Great guy, makes a very boring subject enjoyable."
Shelle is fantastic! She made the class interesting and was very fair with her grading.
"Hard class, but he is a great teacher. If you show up and put the effort in you\'ll do ok. He\'s very intelligent and his sense of humor alone makes going to class worth it most days. Highly recommend the class."
"He is hard to pay attention too because he is a little boring, but he puts the note online and can be funny sometimes in a very cheesy way. He also sometimes ends the class with a video, some are boring, but some are somewhat interesting."
"She is a GREAT teacher! Makes you work hard, gives a real amount of work, and is an incredible person! Couldn\'t get any better!"
"Reed was always there for us, even when he was in the middle of moving to a different state. He always answered my e-mails and posts to message forums very quickly. Tests were easy and you could use your notes. His lectures were very helpful. I wish he taught more graduate level courses in this program."
"Dr. Huff WILL help if you ask and tries his best to engage with the class. It is just a very difficult subject to learn about. He\'s not really boring. He\'s actually very nice, it\'s just the subject that\'s not interesting. He does offer a ton of extra credit and I recommend working with your peers if you want to do well."
"Phil was a great teacher. He was hard on you when he needed to be, but only to your advantage. He cares about his students who care themselves. He knows his stuff and cares about it. Highly valuble guy. He gave me a song that he though woudl fit me. It didn\'t. He told me so, and why...and he was right. Best of luck."
"he thinks he is the most smart person in the world.....hard grader, hard test, good class.Dont expect to get an A on his class."
"Hayward is a cool teacher. However, he doesn\'t open the text book at all for lecture and spends the class telling dirty jokes and he tests every week. I averaged Cs on tests but got an A for doing extra credit. If you\'re a crazy A-obsessed student like I am, do the extra credit EVERY CLASS. It\'s easy to get an A and he\'s made it more than fair. (;"
Best Bible profesor at LU. I love his class and learned everyday. He is very inspirational. You will have to read and study and don\'t hold your breath getting tests back.
"Lots of slideshows, not much clarity. Her in class examples aren\'t overly helpful nor are the slides. You must learn a fair bit outside of class. For my class she claimed we\'d have to memorize formulas and that we wouldn\'t be given any on quizzes or tests HOWEVER she provided pretty much all needed formulas and concepts for all tests and quizzes."
Respectable on so many subjects.
This is one of my favorite professors at Citrus. I took his Political Science 103 course online and was pleased to find a teacher that would allow me to speak my mind with out the shackles of political correctness stifling my views. The material is crystal clear. Not very difficult if you read the required text. Two thumbs way up!
"extremely helpful, understood what he taught, not unreasonable. i would take another class with him"
Julie is ubber-nice but her class is the longest three hours of my week.
"Seriously, one of the most confusing professors ever. She honestly only looked at the figures, so don\'t bother spending too much time reading. DONT FALL BEHIND. You\'ll never sleep if you take this course with another hard course. good luck, and dont waste time"
"Incapable of teaching! Lectures: disorganized, useless Handwriting: almost unreadable. Tests: entirely free response and NO PARTIAL CREDIT. No attendance but he sometimes asks questions about random stuff from lecture on the test. That being said, it is still easy to get an A if you read the book and use premed411 but you wont learn much."
"Dr. Li is difficult to understand at fIrst, he doesn\'t use necessary key words in his speech. Class requires alot of studying, and lots of patients when it comes to drawing the plant cells in lab. Hard class if you don\'t put in the time for it."
I love this class it is the first time i like math a lot!!
"She is professional on this course\'s material, she know what she is teaching in class and she has well-organized notes presented in class. However, for the term tests and final, you need to kill your calculus knowledges (integration tech, derivative) before taking STAT 330 with her... It is all about proving and taking integrations."
"He is such a wise man, that is both friendly and intelligent. Interested in hearing what you have to say. And he has a lot of great stories to tell. It\'s hard to not do well. But he\'s such a great professor that it makes you want to listen as he spits knowledge..."
"very cool and good looking. great lectures. might show up to class, might not. If you dont want to have class, have all of you say you dont want to come, and hes cool with it. no attendance nesessary. drops lowest quiz score. very nice and down to earth"
"The change from high school english to the university level is much harder than expected and in my opinion, she did not do a good job with the preparations. Boring, hard to listen to sometimes, somewhat opinionated. She is a good person at heart though, and you will see that very quickly in the class. Does give help if asked. Do not call after 10."
"very hard to connect with, miss appointment, respond email very slow. grading exam is strange, you need to know what answer he wants. you cannot use any resource out of class or the article he gives us. anyway, good luck"
"Class tough as rawhide. Prof tries to make lecture interesting but not much you can do with the subject material. BUT YOU HAVE TO GO... skip lecture and you will fail. TA gives weekly tutor sessions... go to at least the one before the exam, the pretest is GREAT GOUGE for the real thing."
"I\'m an A student and got my first C at UTSA in this lab! Unfortunately, he\'s your only choice if you have to take Genetics Lab. Doesn\'t teach at all until the ""Review"" he holds on Saturdays that usually lasts 2-4 hours! Horrible professor... beware!"
"I took this class online. It was very easy. Not too many discussion boards to participate in, but there was a lot of extra reading material in addition to required reading in the text book. Study questions and homework questions were super easy and aimed at helping you learn...not making you fail."
"Dr. Neff was great. The class was pretty fun, and he\'s totally willing to help with anything. Some of the labs were hard, but Neff helped me through it all. There is a pizza party on the last lab of the semester. Take him for lab."
"Took him for statistics, graded on 3 exams and attendance. Lectures were slow, but informative. Take notes, problems in class were seen again on tests. He assigns homework practice problems, because he puts them on tests. He\'s technologically challenged, forgets to give breaks in 3 hour classes. He\'s not that bad, but I wouldn\'t take him again."
:)
"Great Professor! You can tell that he loves his job and philosophy. Lots of small group discussion, and debate among the whole class. Papers due once a week. Always grades things and gives them back right away so you know where you stand. Very easy class as long as you participate and do the assignments. He will definately keep you thinking."
So loving and caring!
"Alright, if you looking to be taught something, to actually learn, this is not the professor for. Every week you will have to write a one-page paper explaining what you thought of an article that she assigned you to read. Each class and i do mean EACH class, she will go student to student asking them what they wrote their essay on. THAT IS IT!"
Dr. Olson is a very nice teacher. She cares for her students and is always there to answer any questions. She grades the tax return hard though.
"Lectures arn\'t too thrilling. Looking at slides is the most fun. Projects can end up costing a lot of money (slide film, developing, gas = $20+) but taking the photos was fun, and so was showing them off in class with reactions. Hard work gets you a good grade, slack off and you\'re screwed. Need to"
"Dr. Knight is very talented at teaching and wordplay. You always know you\'re learning a lot, but sometimes you don\'t know if what he says is a slight insult or a haymaker to your ego."
"he is my favorite professor. hes not that available for office hours, but he only has 3 papers a semester. if you do the reading you can learn alot, although there is alot of reading. there is not attendance policy and usually only meets once a week."
"I would give Marty 20 stars, he was an awesome lab instructor. Show up to class, actually try. He will see that and ensure you get what you need to pass. An easy guy to talk to if you have any bio questions. Marty is the boss."
"A tough prof, but you\'ll learn a lot! Very nice to talk to outside class, very helpful."
"Alice is a absolute headcase. She shakes when she talks, talks in circles for hours and her grading policys are terible. Shes kind of a nice lady, she let me get away with alot of stuff, but she can be a huge ****. Make fun of her, but be nice to her to. Total hottie. OH YEAHH HOTTIE"
She was a fantastic teacher and I loved this class!!! Hard class but interesting!
"He is a very funny professor and makes corny funny jokes throughout class. I had him twice in the same semester (anthro 102+Soci 261) and it was fun. He is very helpful with any questions you have. There is a lot of reading!!! Exams are mainly essay exams, rarely gives quizzes."
Amazing professor. Happy to have taken his class.
Professor Nelson is great!
Explains things very well. Makes subject interesting and applicable. Humorous.
"Best teacher ever, very approachable and understanding!"
Her lectures are all online but she does take random attendance. She sends out study guides a couple of days before the test with everything you need to know for the exams. If you put in a little effort than you will do really well in this class! It lead me to decide to add Psych as a second major!
"Galvin is a great teacher, but to do well in his class, you have to have the skill of taking good notes straight from the lecture without powerpoint or the board being used. MMM is a very difficult class but he does a great job making sure everyone understands everything."
this class was VERY boring. his tests were reallyl tricky. he\'s very unclear about what he wants. he is easy though.you just sleep a lot.
I loved this class! Dr. Bob knows what he is talking about and wants his students to learn. He really makes an effort to make sure his students succeed on his tests. We took 3 quizzes (about 30 multiple choice question) and 3 tests (about 50 mult choice questions) during the class. There was also an optional final which can only help your grade!
"He is horrible and has admitted that if he does not like you, then he will fail you. A girl in my class got an A but he then changed it to a C because he does not like her. He hates questions and has admitted that he does not prepare you for 1302."
He is so easy. 4 essays over the semester and the last essay comes with a presentation which is your final exam grade-- easy A. took him for 2 semesters. He is boring though but it is an easy grade so i definitely recommend him if you\'re looking for a class where you don\'t have much work and need to focus on other classes.
"Took him for audience. That class was the biggest waste of time. He is incredibly slow about giving you any of your work back and has you read and write ridiculous things. I liked him at the beginning of the semester because he has a lot of structure to the class, but I rapidly started to dislike him when I saw his random ridiculously hard grading"
Sucks A$$... Runs like 30 minutes after the class is over... and is offened if u need to leave... Even for Another Class!!!
more confusing as each class goes along
yeah no. To say her classes are awful is being nice.
"Yeah, he\'s arrogant, he\'s condescending and blunt. But he\'s also a most excellent organ teacher. He taught me more about HOW to play the pipe organ in one semester than I got from many years of previous lessons."
really impressive
"This class was crazy, and Allen is a lot of fun. But I wouldn\'t say she was the best professor at VT."
I love Professor Ard!! She\'s a wonderful Professor who really knows what she\'s talking about. She gives excellent reviews for exams and is really easy going. She makes classicl music extremely interesting!!!
"Her power points dont seem to follow any outline format. She throws out numbers and letters and doesnt give decent time to take notes. Very monotone voice and seems like a strange woman. Class is boring and she expects a lot on the papers. Harder than expected, but survivable class."
"Worst teacher in the world, if you are lucky enough to have him show up for class. In first year our 8am 2 hour class he didnt bother showing up to 6 of them with no heads up. Next class was at 1pm WASTE OF TIME"
"She is a very nice lady, but she makes things much more confusing than they need to be and is an extremely hard marker. The assignments and midterms are quite difficult."
He tries but you really learn almost nothing in class. Just study out of the book if the Physics dept decides to keep it where you go to class 1 day and problem sess another. Do the problems. The final is hard. Or at least it was this semester. Do whatever you can.
"Prof. James is amazing. Its because of him that I decided to major in education. Hes an inspirational teacher, he loves what he teaches and hes great at it. Every educator should be like Mr. James, hes truly a wonderful teacher. He teaches with passion and humor, keeping his students interested. A++"
"Dr. Crouse is an excellent professor. He is very in-depth and his class is difficult, but if you take him you will learn chemistry! He is an organic chemist, so he likes to ask questions about it often. Great for pre-meds. Do the problems in the back of the book if you want to make an A. Also, make sure you read the text."
"wonderful teacher. You really learn in her class. Expect to do the work, she doen\'t let people slack. She teaches a lot from the textbook. Her lectures are interesting. She is tough, but fair."
"I felt i hav to write somethin good about Jill, she is passionate and exciting ... also knowledgable, i\'d lov to take some more class with Mac:) She is certainly best prof from em ..."
Pretty good prof. He traches like he\'s a high school teacher. Lots of class discussions and group activities. You do a book report instead of an essay and there\'s no text. Pretty easy marker -especially on the book report- so just read the notes and you\'ll be fine.
"AMAZING teacher she really knew it all, and she worked around ""life"" very understandable and does her best to help you pass her class!"
"Holy CRAP, you dont take this course unless you are an accouting major. Can\'t someone make taxation more fun? I dreaded going to this class everday because the material was all over the board as well as the discussion. The final was about the worst part. Avoid this class if it involved Hagg teaching it"
"I did not mind the course as much as I thought I would based on reviews from other students. He is a very vague person and professor, but offered a lot of interesting and provoking ideas and assignments."
"great professor, just make sure you take notes for your tests. She gives study guides and they\'re exactly like the test. Her lectures are very powerful and you\'ll be very interested into the course and you\'ll get an easy grade! There\'s a group presentation at the end of class and you pretty much decide your groups. Dont need your text book"
"Dr. Dietz was by far one of my favorite professors I have ever had. You can tell from her lectures that she truly cares about her subject and her students. Her tests are a bit challenging since they are mostly essay based, but if you go to class and go to the SI sessions for the primary sources she gives you, you will have no issues succeeding."
"Do not take this class unless you love math or are a hydrology major. Literally everyone in the class that was a geography, sustainability, or other non-science major have no idea what she is talking about. Reading responses are worth almost nothing and each homework assignment is 7% of your grade! I will not be retaking this professor or class."
"Ray is a wonderful professor. He seems to want nothing more than to help his students excel. We\'re not all natural artists, I\'m certainly not, which he understands. He\'s a smart guy and can tell when a student isn\'t invested or putting forth effort. As with any other class, do the work and you\'ll do well. I would absolutely take him again!"
"This class is demanding, especially at the beginning, but I think he purposely assigns a lot of reading to reduce the class size. Study hard for the first quiz, and it gets better from there. If you do the reading, go to class and participate you\'ll do fine. Don\'t be intimidated by Enrique either, he\'s very helpful and understanding!"
"WHAT a great guy! Rod is so down to earth. I always really enjoyed talking with him in and outside the classroom. One thing I really liked about him is that he was never condescending and valued everyone\'s opinion in the classroom. He was also always there to help. There is definitely a lot of work, but overall I really enjoyed the class."
Dhatt is a professor who shows care for his students education and makes a student want to succeed. Great comedian great professor!
"Not my favorite prof, but he\'s a good guy. His lectures often seemed to jump around and some things were unclear. I basically taught myself from the book the entire semester. Gives a handout on exactly what will be on the test, so if you put in the work you will pass."
She\'s a tough grader. Hard to understand what she\'s saying. No mercy. If u want to fail take this class.
"do yourself the favor of your lifetime and take this class. bob sullivan is precious. he loves what he does, he loves h-burg, and he loves his students. he\'s not THAT easy-study your notes for tests. but he is hilarious (w/o knowing it) and i never leave class without a smile or learning something."
"Dr. Etter is pretty cool. There 3 tests, including the final which is not cumulative, and a term paper that is known about the entire semester. He always rounded my tests to the highest percentage. He posts all his power points on blackboard and does not take attendance. Easy A."
"Talks fast. She is serious about her material and can get snippy if you don\'t take it seriuosly as well. Tests all essay, just listen to what she wants-on tests and on papers. Then it\'s easy. My first 4! It\'s amazing the knowledge this woman has obtained over the years. Has many contacts in the art world."
"Starts out very fast & you can\'t keep up, but he\'s just doing an overview of the class. Later gets into detail on each topic, and it gets easier. DO THE EXTRA CREDIT, because the test questions are misleading and worded poorly. His teaching is a bit haphazard where he goes off on many tangents. He could learn to be more linear and prepared."
"His worksheets have problems that will be on the test, and he has review lectures where he narrows down what you need to know for the exam, but his MC is convoluted and picky and he doesn\'t do much to inspire the class. Pay attention to what he says you\'ll need to know and you\'ll do alright, but on the multiple choice, best of luck to you."
this guy\'s awesome. definitely worth taking a class with him - he has fun with the project assignments and gives us alot of free reign to go with them. he\'s pretty helpful and maybe a little lax. he knows his stuff and helps you figure out whatever you\'re working on.
"Will answer any questions, if asked...but you MUST ask. Lectures are clear and well structured. Generally interested in helping you if you want help."
Awesome teacher. How does he only have one chili pepper? He is a wealth of knowledge. He is also super fun. Don\'t expect a pity grade though. He does have standards.
best nursing professor at HACC!
Carrie is wonderful! Best PE teacher at ISU.
"One of the best teachers I came across while attending AU. He will bend over backwards for any student, gives the best guidence (as I had 3 different advisors), and is so pationate about the subject matter you can not help but get enthrawled in his lessons and personal stories. Would take any class with him again!"
Nice teacher
"Very clear lectures. Relatively easy class compared to other math classes I\'ve taken. Homework is VERY important. If you do the homework, and understand the problems very well, you will do well on his tests."
Mr. Poncetta was an excellent teacher and very kind. He\'s knowledgeable about agriculture and makes class interesting. He gives you plenty of time to complete assignments and extra credit. He will go over EVERYTHING you need to know for the tests and quizzes multiple times. he wants you to pass as well as understand the material. THERE IS NO BOOK.
Monterosso is a really nice and smart professor. I took his drugs class for GE4 and it was great. The class isn\'t too difficult to do well in and the topics covered are pretty interesting.
Professor McCraw knows a lot about the Chinese ancient history and culture. And he is very helpful.
"She has such passion for her teaching. Seriously, I did not expect much coming in, but she kind of inspired me! Definitely take her class."
"Not worth it! You\'ll read that he\'s easy, but as an Honors Student, I can honestly say ""ignore that"". While testing may be simple, sitting through 3 hours of Prof. H\'s snide, demeaning comments sucks the life out of his subject. And he always blames his catty comments on the fact that he\'s from NY. It doesn\'t matter where you\'re from: mean is mean!"
"very good teacher, is helpful, wants to have everyone pass and works with everyone to achieve that. available outside class to help, answers mails, homework done on mathlab only for participation, not a grade. tests and quizes are multiple choice. explains things in levels building up your skills as we go along. wish i could have him 4 all my math"
Awesome teacher! Really supportive of his students and understanding of their situations. Great use of today\'s problems in lessons and fun group activities. Don\'t forget to remind him about the jokes!!!!!
"Are we talking about the same person? He is lively makes archaeology interesting has great lectures and is very academic. Yes lots of reading and challenging exams but grading was very fair as far as I could see, and this is not high school.My guess is if you got a bad grade you probably deserved it"
"Super easy class. It was easier than a lot of my classes in high school. However, she goes through her notes rather quickly so be prepared for your hand to hurt at the end of class. Naz is a really fun and nice teacher though."
"I perceive him as being well-versed, but he has a very heavy accent and is hard to understand during lecture. He is Turkish, soft-spoken, and it\'s quite obvious he has trouble communicating what\'s on his mind at times. Lecture is almost useless, tests not particularly difficult, but I would recommend avoiding."
"He is extremely easy and if you have taken other international affairs classes or political science classes, then this class is horribly redundant. Just read his slides, no need for notes."
"After reading comments below about this professor crushing your GPA for no other reason than her misery, this is completely true. Its a blatant gen ed class, and she takes personal offense to the fact that her students have other priorities. DO NOT take this class."
"awesome teacher, she clearly goes through everything and wont continue if there are questions. quizes are easy and her class is interesting."
"Very engaging teaching style, great professor and encourages deeper thought."
I absolutely loved Jessica! She was a super easy grader and if you send her your paper she will help you fix anything to get an A! She\'s super chill and laid back. Would definitely take her again!
"BORING! This is guy can put you to sleep easy. I learned nothing and wasted my money on the book. He\'s a nice guy, but he needs some lessons on making lectures more interesting and interactive. Skip."
"Great teacher, very helpful and extremely knowledgable. He is also very patient and understanding. You will learn a lot. I highly recommend him."
Dave Moen is the biggest stud at USD. MOEN FOR PRESIDENT!!!
"Martin is the King of Kings. Lead acid soup, booyah."
terrible person.
Honestly one of the best teachers I could have had to start off my CSUB experience
"Amazing professor! She cares about her students and continuously pushes them to express their opinions. There is a lot of reading, but it is manageable. Her picks are always interesting to read. There are two essays each semester & a handful of textual analysis. I recommend going to office hours for feedback. She is also a great campus resource!"
"i had her for lab and was very unclear but is willing to help, if help is available"
she gives lots of homework but she\'s really makes sure you understand her lesson. I would take her again but she\'s not teaching math 114..
"If you are a full time student and part time worker this class is difficult to keep up with. She expected us to read a story every week, do a discussion post and a quiz. The stories are pretty long and take time to understand. Also, don\'t expect to make above a 90 on your posts even if they are good and meet the criteria."
Keith is an asset to the Graphic Design program.
"Ziv is amazing, both in his personality and in the way he lectures. The only class I have ever taken in which the professor really did lecture. No powerpoint or unnecessary technology, Ziv really conveys all the information required in his classes. Outside reading is helpful but he covers so much in class. 100% recommend. Interest material too."
A very good teacher.
He was just so boring.
"VERY DIFFICULT TO STAY AWAKE during her lectures. Spent first three days of classes lecturing on how ""rude"" it was to her and ""your peers"" when you arrive even 1 minute late. Somewhat picky on papers...NOT AN EASY B. Takes attendance everyday...greatly affects your grade if you skip more than 1-2x. DO NOT TAKE PHIL 236 UNLESS REQUIRED"
Lacey likes to talk about himself and his experiences so lectures can be a little boring. Does I-clicker questions so you should show up. Learned from the book more than in class so definitely rent the book but he does do examples you just have to follow along. Homework is online- Wiley-plus. Exams aren\'t too hard and he curves them.
Very good teacher. Tests are ok if you study (sometimes if you don\'t). Would definitely take this teacher again.
Ok
"EXECELLENT TEACHER, CARES ABOUT STUDENTS DOING WELL IN HER CLASS, GIVES EXTRA CREDIT, TEACHES EXACTLY WHAT WILL BE ON HER TEST, SO STUDY HARD, LOTS OF MATERIAL, DEFINITELY RECOMMEND TAKING HER"
"Hasselblatt is definitely better than the other teachers teaching this course, but that really isnt saying much. The book was pretty bad too. Compared to the calculus sequence, DE is really poorly organized and presented. All in all, Hasselblatt is a pretty average college professor...he does try hard though"
"He was more confused than we the students were. Reading the book on top of his lectures will only be minimal help, which still won\'t be enough. Even getting a B is tricky! But if you are patient, he is a nice guy and tries to work with you."
Worst teacher ever. Expects you to know what he is teaching. The tests are hard because its different than the problems assigned for hw. Hard to approach. No fun.
The class was really laid back and was easier than expected (for non-philosophy majors). Not a lot of reading or extra work.
Great teacher and nice person. I still think about how much I learned in his class and cherish those moments that have now gone!!
He seems to be teaching only to get a pay check. Whenever you do ask questions he makes snide remarks. He does not seem like a friendly person. You should only take his classes if you are a die hard ceramics fan. He expects you to do devote all your time to ceramics.
La clase de espa\xc3\xb1ol Finnie es muy divertido. \xc3\x89l hace la clase f\xc3\xa1cil de entender y le ayudar\xc3\xa1 con todo lo que usted necesita. (Finnie\'s spanish class is so much fun. He makes the class easy to understand and will help you with anything that you need.)
"Hands down my favorite professor at LC. Crazy intelligent, super funny, and always there to make sure you really understand the material."
"Dr. Magyar is pretty nice outiside of class if you have a question and need to see him in the office. However, in class he can be condescending and answers questions with sarcasm at times. He puts a great emphasis on the concept and not necessarily memorizing reactions and mechanisms. He will challenge you to think critically and is quite difficult"
"Overall, Mr. Cox is a really nice guy but his lecture is pretty much confusing. His slides are not well organized. Sometimes just few pictures or graphs showed. He teaches the world region geography totally not in the tradition way which is so interesting. By the way, there are just 4 tests, no homework."
"Really awesome professor. Knows how to keep discussions going, and makes the material interesting even when it\'s not. Just a great guy. I highly recommend taking one of his classes."
"interesting if ur a liberal. tests pop out of sometimes, strange grader. course readings are interesting."
Dr Smarook is a great educator
"Lectures go fast. Half of class time is used for lecture, other half is used for work problems you do with a group. Exams are extremely difficult, I did not enjoy this class."
"Great guy and a fairly good teach, but he is quite lazy. LOL! I did not get a single homework back before the midterm, and I do not expect to get anything back before the final. I guess he figures he only has to work the 4-5 hours he is at school."
The class is gonna be boring no matter what. She tries to be funny. Class at 8:00am with NO skips allowed is pretty rough. Cummulative tests are annoying. Do the homework. Not the worst experience of my life. There are worse Comp Lit teachers.
Ab Psysh. Doesn\'t teach. Tests EVERY class. Tests don\'t quite match textbook. What is taught is more or a discussion...USELESS.
"Spanish 04 (Intermediate Spanish) is an online course, so it\'s a different environment. She is really good at getting things graded and keeping in contact with her. Just keep in contact with her all the time and turn EVERYTHING in."
"She\'s really bad. I would have to say she is one of the worst teachers I\'ve had in my whole academic career. The tests are nothing like what she teaches in class, and the fact that you whole grade is pretty much the exams is a big disadvantage. I would not suggest her if you actually want to learn accounting."
Practical and Relevant Information. This is material that you will use day 1 in the professional world. Helpful and engaging
"He means well, speech\'s and assignments are easy, but you have to study for the test/quiz, gives review but not exactly over the test, so reading the book is required very thoroughly. Study! other than that it\'s not that complicated."
"Mrs. Bradley is a great teacher. She expects her students to do the work so don\'t think you\'re going to skate through her class. It\'s not terribly difficult to get a good grade in her class, but you do have to make considerable effort. If you have problems or life concerns, she is very understanding and helpful."
Wasting the Wind Ensemble\'s time with the music chosen. Alfred Reed is all he does. Has no variety.
"I hated this class. It should be a 3 week class at most. We went over stuff the first few days, but for the majority for the semster it was just rambling about random stuff and him going \'write this down, its going to be on your final\'. We\'re not finished yet, but getting an A is supposed to be easy. I just wish he\'d let us out"
"no good, needs to do research and get out of teaching"
This is the most pathetic excuse for a teacher. My confidence in the school dropped 100% when I took his class. Someone PLEASE fire him!!! I learned absolutely Nothing in his classes - ever. I actually felt less intelligent with every hour spent with him.
He\'s terrible. He\'s so boring and his lectures have nothing to do with the books. Stay away from his class unless you need to catch up on your sleep.
she is a great teacher!! very fair and understanding. Plus she is easy on the eyes. the first test is hard. i started out with a 62 and ended withe an 88... A+++ professor
"Funny personal stories; fun to listen to, but sidetracked."
Pretty hard. Goes way too in depth for the length of time you have. Takes a long time to grade papers
"This is the Amy Whinehouse of teaching: ask her a question, the answer is always NO NO NO. (Not exageratting: WHINEHOUSE)."
Awful awful awful. 3 solid hours every monday morning writing on the ohp. Never got through a lesson plan in the entire module.
"Jennings seems like a very nice person, but is useless as a lecturer. Lectures are all over the place subject-wise. Talks an awful lot, but I never have any notes. Too much reading. He\'s a touch full of himself. A lot of French, not European history. Should be interesting material, but taught in a very disjointed manner."
"This is a fun class, and he provides all the notes. All you have to do is print them off fill in the blanks."
"Around 10 quizzes and 10-12 homework assignments. He drops the lowest grade of each. Midterm, Final and a project. Project is fairly difficult but is doable, he gives ample time to do it and helps in class. Be prepared to put in 10 hours or more. The tests have T/F, fill in the blank and solving. He is a funny and nice guy. I would take him again."
so confused after one day that i dropepd the class and warned others to never take him
Online C++ programming requires that one be independent and highly motivated. The instructor did not make his expectations for assignments as clear as desirable.
"funny in the beginning. got more boring as time went on. NO NEED TO SHOW TO LECTURE. basically, you do nothing until the essay comes. essays are hard and confusing to understand. BEFRIEND TA-THEY GIVE YOU YOUR GRADE"
"I took professor Lynch for 3 management classes at SSU. I can honestly say she is by far one of my favorite professors. Not only is she knowledgeable, she truly cares for her students and that they learn from her courses. I have so much respect for her teaching style, her enthusiasm for the material, and her overall positive demeanor. :)"
"claire is totally a great, fun teacher and person."
Great teacher
"very smart knows what he\'s talking about thoroughly but seems like he\'s out to prove you cannot succeed in his class, though some do. Kind of a jerk, should be in politics not teaching about it."
Eye candy and pretty easy grading
Easy A+++++++++++++++++++++ Ha hah ahahha ha
awful
"Homeworks are standard difficulty. Only need to focus on midterm and final. Excellent teacher. Speaks clearly, but this guy needs more sleep hahahaha."
"I took the online version of this class. You have a weekly homework/discussion to complete. Tests are taken every other week. Pretty simple class, I didn\'t need a textbook because a summary and test review is given prior to the test. Just read over those and you\'ll be fine. He does provide extra credit if you got a bad grade on one test."
"He\'s a really nice guy, and was very helpful. He\'s always got tons of students waiting outside his office.....so sometimes you gotta wait a while to actually get in and see him or ask him something, but he\'s always nice and pleasant."
"The class was rather slow and extreamly self taught. There were for projects due and each one you had a month to do, I acomplished the 1st one in one class period and the 2nd one as well. The final project is whatever you want and I feel as if i learned nothing. Anything I did learn I taught myself. I do NOT reccomend taking him."
Easy cool profesor! Do the work and hell pass you!
"Great class, very informative. Enjoyable and easy to follow."
"Hot. Good teacher and course content too,."
"Easily the best professor I\'ve ever had. He is willing to help you on everything! Only a few papers and you get to pick the topics. Some very easy group stuff done in class. He wants students to succeed but will not spoon feed you, so pay attention to the handouts, rubrics, do the assignments, and you\'ll get an A."
"Don\'t take him even if it means holding out for an extra semester. None of the quiz or test questions were related to lecture, lecture was useless and he often assigned homework problems that were not on the quizzes/exams, but different types of problems were. He has an old-school fashion of phrasing chemistry questions which is hard to understand."
Nicole is a sweet person who is like a friend. She is understanding. Offers alot of easy extracredit. You do write like 10 essays but they\'re not very hard. Be into the discussions she likes that
DR. PATTERSON IS THE BEST CHOICE TO GO WITH WHEN YOU HAVE TO TAKE STATISTICS. WORK HARD AND GO TO EVERY CLASS. TAKE THIS PROFESSOR!!
I have now taken two of Boyer\'s classes and love them. This was the star wars class. I found it very enjoyable even though I am not a star wars fan. I only had to do 3 disscusion sheets.
"She\'s a really nice teacher. Her classes are interesting, and if you pay attention its relatively easy to get an A. If you\'re an econ major and you need a good class that will also boost your GPA, Barbezat is the professor for you."
Simply the best professor I have ever taken at Ryerson. I highly recommend taking her if you want to get an A. Make sure to attend all classes as most if not all of what she teaches is from her class notes. She makes learning enjoyable
"Nice professor. 3 take home exams. those are not hard if you use e-book. you can search words and get the answers. there are also short essay questions and you need to answer with 7-10 sentences for each question. Don\'t miss classes cuz you may not makeup class activity. Nice class, strongly recommend!!"
"Tricky prof. Course breakdown (40% participation 20% for attendance + 20% online commentaries), 30% assignment, 30% final. While it is possible to received 40/40 on participation you will be losing marks on assignment, even more so on the final. Final exam is absolutely tough. Overall he is ok, but needs to be more relaxed with grading."
"Frau Frisk was very attentive. She was approachable and concerned with my progress. She arrived on time for class and kept regular, (even extra), office hours to help with questions and concerns regarding class. As someone who struggles with public speaking, I thought she really made an effort to make her class comfortable, inviting and engaging!"
"He is by far the best teacher I\'ve had. He\'s down earth and I can actually listen to and enjoy his lectures. He\'s to the point and structured, but also knows how to lighten the often dreary subjects we cover in the Mortuary Science program.If anyone were to say something bad about him It\'s probably because they\'re too stupid to pass his classes"
Very easy teacher. Sometimes lectures gets hard to follow when he starts multiple examples at once and only partially erases the board. Tests are a walk in the park. I think he has limited hearing and a very limited wardrobe.
"He is awesome! Many people from Macro are in Micro now. Go to class, do the hw (tests are based off hw) and go the class before the test (play a game and uses ?\'s from test) and you should get an A. Great guy too and funny!"
my favorite
"He\'s clear, patient, methodical and an expert in this field, but if you\'ve never taken physics or calculus, he warns you, you should not take the class. If you insist, he\'ll not stop you, but be prepared to be at the bottom of the curve. No participation or extra credit to help boost your grade. For exams, you know the material, or you don\'t."
"Professor Hager, please reconsider teaching math 30. We need you here at Golden West :) you are one of the best math teachers I have come across."
"Please retire. NOW! Actually a nice guy, but very boring, and frustrating as regards grades. But in the end, he gives A\'s out like candy as long as you show up and do your work."
"I just want to add that her exams make no sense! The essay questions were ridiculous! Her quotes that we had to match with the text, and speaker were so out there. Even if you read the texts you still could not remember who said what. She does curve the exams though, which is a plus, because everyone must do so poorly."
"Ditto the rest. Nice, lazy, arbitrary."
"i never looked forward to anything too much work, but shes nice"
This class was way over my head. I was excited when I found out papers are a page long but I received Ds or Fs on my papers that I thought were well written! Its awesome she worked for the CIA so I was excited for her class but she\'s an extremely tough grader. I went to her for help with my papers and she didn\'t give good feedback. Dropped class.
She is really nice and helpful... but make sure to do the readings and attend class and your\'ll do really well.
"Brilliant man. Loves to talk, ususally has some really interesting/off the wall ideas. Don\'t let it get to you if he takes forever grading assignments. He\'s fair, the class is an easy A if you make an effort, but if you hand in a poorly written paper, expect him to call you on it. Litton really cares about his Honors kids."
"She may be a tough grader and a lot of work, but she is an amazing human being. You will never find a professor more passionate about her work and about teaching. She will gladly help anyone who is willing to put in the work and loves her students deeply. Don\'t be scared to go to her with anything, she\'s incredible!"
"For a thesis advisor he is much more critical than he is helpful. Must adhere to his strict writing style and if it doe not align he will criticize until it does. He is very smart and well versed in politics, but fails to realize that we are undergrads writing a senior thesis, not a PhD student and their dissertation."
Ms. Matuszewski is a really hard grader on homework and essays. This professor is not organize and not clear on the homework. There is always homework and is required to go to the writing center. Attendance is mandatory. There is always group discussion. Textbook is required at all times. The comments on the essays are very harsh.
"Dr. Durrant is by far the best professor I have had at BYU. He is hilarious and really makes the class material interesting. He is super laid back and easy going. We didn\'t have any tests but instead had a quiz every couple of weeks, There is also a few assignments based on our readings.. we had no final, instead we did a big video project . :)"
"Dr. Sue is a good online teacher. Due dates are obvious and she keeps in touch with students and gives comments on assignments for improvement. At first, there seems to be a lot on the syllabus in terms of rules and do this and that, but once you get the hang of it, it\'s just the same schedule for the rest of the course. I\'m glad I took it."
Interesting to listen to but his tests are hard. Final was horrendous....had to watch video and identify what area of geog. in which it was filmed....blah
expects students to do way to much work for her class. Doesn\'t take in the views of anyone other thatn herself. Do NOT take this class.
Quite the interesting fellow. Do the assignments and show up to class without an attitude problem and you\'ll be fine. He can get a little annoying sometimes just because people tend to take advantedge of his good nature and walk all over him until he snaps and gets upset. Really nice guy though.
Great class. Amazing professor.
"If you are a jock, you are favored, if you are male and a jock you are very favored. If you are female regardless of being a jock, you are expected to do the assignments for the male jocks that can\'t arrive on time. Sleeping and texting are both allowed in class."
"I loved Mrs. Harvest, she kept the class interesting. I took Comm2 in the Summer mini-mester and I probably would have taken it in a regular semester if I would have known how much work there was going to be. The only advise I can give is do all the work, and you should get a good grade"
"There is a lot of homework on this website MindTap and its always having problems. He can be very short at times and gets frustrated when all of his student email him about it (we just care about our grade) but other than that he\'s very mediocre. I didn\'t learn much from him, I learned more from the homework online."
A really great teacher who cares about his students and the subject material. It is true that is biased with his Christian views but most of the time he keeps his opinion to the minimum and NEVER preaches. Very knowledgable and well versed in his classes.
He was an excellent teacher! I am horrible at math and he really helped me to pass the class!
"Mr. Lora is a great teacher! He likes to make jokes in class which helps lighten the mood, and he always plays awesome old rock tunes before class. The tests are a bit tough, but he is there for you if you have any questions. I haven\'t finished his class yet, but I already know that I\'d definitely take it again!!"
"I\'m pretty sure that she comes high every class(you can tell by the sunglasses indoor) so it helps to come to the class high to really appreciate what she is saying. However, the workshopping is really helpful, and my writing got better. And you have to get an A on the first few papers."
I left SDSU in 1989 and Dr. Boe is the only professor\'s name I remember. His class on the Bible as literature was lasting.
"Not a bad class, you just have to be respectful to Larsen and you\'ll get on his good side. He gave me a lot of extra credit at the end of the semester because I always paid attention and asked questions. His tests are 50% conceptual so the book and slides are definitely needed."
"Appgar is a great guy. He\'s super chill and fun to be around, which is important if you\'re doing FYP. It\'s easy to goof off in his class, but take the final project VERY seriously. It will make or break you. Dropped me almost a full letter grade."
"this is so terrible teacher, she doesn\'t know how to teach, just to talk about her family, poorly explain and hard exams. don\'t take her class."
He is very emotionally involved with the material. Plus side is that he is very knowledgeable on the subject and encourages you to be involved in the conversation and voice your opinion. He is overly hesitant about trying to understand the motivations of the persecutors.
she\'s great!
"Borella\'s class is very boring. I honestly learned nothing in his class. His Natural Hazards class consisted of two tests, both were essay question, and both were extremely difficult. I studied my butt off and got a 20% on the mid term. It is completely unclear what he wants. His test questions have nothing to do with what is in the book."
"It seems the primary complaint about Dr. Devlin\'s classes is their difficulty; while they are no walk in the park, Dr. D couldn\'t be cooler, kinder, or more willing to help her students. You won\'t be handed an A without putting in the work, but she will do her best to help you understand and succeed, all while keeping the atmosphere light and fun"
"TONS of extra credit! I hate algebra and normally do not do well, getting 110% in his class because of extra credit. ALL HOMEWORK is for extra credit, none is collected and graded- you just SHOW it him when you hand in the tests. Seems rough around the edges, maybe cocky, but he\'s great. More than willing to help you if you need any clarifying!"
"Talks alot about content not on the exams, but is interesting for a history buff."
This class was so much fun. I looked forward to it more than anything else this semester. I wasn\'t a poet before this class but the professor helped me become one. She made everyone in the class feel welcome.
"He is a great teacher and tries to ensure that everyone understands the class. He is friendly, helpful and genuinely cares about his students. If you gotta take this class he is definately the one to take it with!"
"The class sounded interesting to me, but you will not learn much. Just take a glance at some Latin American countries on Wikipedia if you want to know. We read 3 books which were interesting, but I\'m a design student so I really did not have time to read them. Professor Shain assumes the students are ignorant of everything, kind of annoying."
Judy was amazing! This is my second semester with Judy and she just keeps getting better :) i reccommend her to any teaching major because not only does she teach you the math aspects (which are not difficult at all) but she give you great advice for being a teacher. She also is very concered about your welling being both in her class and out.
"She was AWESOME. So funny, so entertaining. Treated you like a friend, made you feel like there was NEVER a wrong answer. Always had a blast in her class. But very strict on attendance, totally worth it though showing up to her class was my favorite part of the day anyway! She rocks and she is just adorable."
"Professor Barton is the most awesome professor. She is VERY knowledgeable, personable, offers her help with anything. She provides her contact info upfront and response immediately every time. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND her and REALLY wish she taught more classes. learned SO MUCH from her and her class. I never liked Physical Science much but now I love it"
"Wonderful woman! Dont annoy her, be mature & respectful! Don\'t miss class, write notes like a robot & memorize them like your name! For tests, regurgitate class notes & study in groups lest you miss important terms/ideas! Read book before she starts it(see calendar)! For final paper, research very deeply & write about what interests YOU, not her!"
"Very disorganized. Seems to have no clue what\'s going on. rather unclear at times. Teaching a bunch of seniors the basics of genetics -- uh, we\'ve all taken the class..."
"Total nut, according to him there is only one way of approaching an equation and that is the way he teaches it. Takes weeks to grade tests and loses his temper when asked to explain again."
be carfule
Everytime I left this class last year I felt like I had been encouraged to look at literature in a new way. M makes you feel important and is very eager to get her students excited about the material. This class (Fact/Fiction Writers on the Verge) was the ideal thing to being my college career with last year.
"He is a very kind man, but he is almost impossible to follow. Since he is a philosophy major he talks at a level that none of the students can understand. The class is full lecture with NO WRITTEN DOWN NOTES."
"Interesting teacher. I took Karate from him. Is a curious mixture between Steve Carrell and the midget from Benchwarmers (picture that!). Knows Karate very well. I believe he is like a Level-5 Black Belt. If you want to learn Karate good, if you want an interesting Thursday night not so good."
He is very knowledgeable in history. It is nice to have someone teaching a class they actually know the information not just a textbook. It is not easy but if you want to learn he is the professor to have.
"Dr Belpedio is tough--there\'s no doubt about it. I found him very funny and endearing. Very aloof, definitely cold. He knows his stuff. Tough grader, but once you know what he\'s looking for you can phone the assignments in. I\'d recommend him as an elective professor. He will broaden your horizons on things he clearly knows about."
Very difficult grader. You don\'t quite know what he wants. Very nice though.
"Very difficult class -- but when you finish, you are certain you can succeed at major univerisities like the UW. He will help you. But you will need to work hard."
"Great teacher, very easy and fun. Laid back attitude was enjoyable. I took the summer course and we only had 2 tests and 2 papers, both really easy i got an A- in the class. Topics discussed in class were enjoyable and keep you intrested most of the time. His accent is not hard to understand and at sometimes, funny. Take him for an easy A."
"Flachmann is by far my favorite professor! This class was challenging but so much fun. It is easy to get a good grade if read, go to class and participate. He really does not ask that much of you. Just do the work and I promise you will have a great time!"
Richard is an amazing prof. If you take the time to attend his classes & listen to his lectures you will learn very quickly that he is an extremely intelligent & well spoken man. He takes great pride in his students & is the most friendly & helpful prof I have ever had. easily available powerpoints for all classes. always available for extra help
"Took Physics with him, he was fun, at times entertaining and a good guy... but also assumed we had all had physics before and tended to rush through material... he gave us lots of problems to solve but he would solve them on the board before we got a chance to think for ourselves. It was frustrating at times!"
She knows her stuff. She was a great help in learning the information. If you show any effort she will be willing to help.
"Professor El Askary is super nice and helpful. He can be confusing because he gets really into the lectures and loses people, but he\'s very willing to answer all questions in great detail. Very available for help through email and office hours. I didn\'t love the class, but I don\'t love science, so. But as a teacher, he\'s great."
Very interesting and clear. It\'s a hard but fun class.
"took him for sen sem and got an A, never talked to the man but I like A\'s!"
"This online class was pretty time consuming. She took until the very last day of the semester to get everything graded, needed losts of reminders about extra credit submissions, and emailed her personal problems as an excuse for falling behind. She sent out several rude emails too. Not to professional from my perspective."
"I love Mrs. Breakwell. She is the most attentive professor I have ever had. She would notice if I was gone, and message me to make sure I was ok. She is super energetic and exciting. You have to write a lot in class but she is so helpful and willing to work with you, and your needs. No book is required. The only downside was a 25 page paper ."
Very Socratic style of teaching. Gives you all the lecture notes at the beginning and then the lecture summaries after each lecture. Just pay attention in lecture and keep up with the reading.
"Totally disorganized. Changes assignments during the week the assignment was due. Never, never there for office hours. Not helpful anyway. Avoid."
Prof.Latoja was a wonderful online professor he graded the exams fairly quickly and kept people updated when ever a situation arrived. His exams became a little harder throughout the course. Make sure you take the online assignments seriously because they can be used on one of the exams. He is not tricky at all I loved his online class. :)
this teacher is the most amazing teacher ever! i have taken her for both eng classes and i wouldnt take anyone else! she is the ideal teacher! do your work and show up to class and you have a for sure A+. she is fair to all her students and understands everyones situations. Recommend her for all Eng courses!
"Dr. Chen is the man! Has an Asian accent, but he is still understandable. He tries very very very hard to make sure all his students get good grades. The extra points he gives is CRAZY. To get an A is a 90 and above, and even if your midterm and final grades don\'t add up, attendance and pop quizzes ADD A LOT. Study his slides and you\'re good to go."
I really learned a lot! She knows her subject very well.
"He is not a nice man and does not explain anything at all, if you are just trying to get your lab out of the way like me, dont take him"
"This class was super easy. 7 one page assignments are due throughout the course of the semester, and one group project at the end. The assignments are over the power points lectured in class. Go to class 75% of the time and you will pass!"
"I had this class for three hours Thursday nights but we never went the full time. It\'s fun to listen to her because she is from Germany and has an accent but the lectures are pointless and boring. Such an easy class all you need to do is 1. do the homework, 2. write two papers, and 3. attend class for participation grade. The two tests are okay."
This class is really easy but I felt I didn\'t learn a lot from the class -- basically it\'s all about students doing presentations and attending concerts. It\'s not about structural knowledge and some presentations are really unprepared. Prof Negrete is kind and willing to have a discussion with you. (But the syllabus keeps changing all the time!)
"She was a very approachable instructor, and her office hours were convenient, as well as helpful. Lots of homework, but the practice is necessary. Tests are fairly easy, and the online homework has unlimited tries. Her sense of humor also makes math more fun."
"Thorough, step by step instuctions on how to build basic web pages. If there were questions, Johnny was very helpful with his answers. Johnny was also very positive. Highly recommend!"
she is soo picky; she takes pints off for the stupidest things.
"Hughes was absolutely great. It didn\'t even feel like a class, it was more like a cool hang out while learning about new things. He often shows random and crazy Youtube videos that even more randomly tie into the lecture. He\'s a really sweet guy and cares a lot about his students. If you get the chance, TAKE HIS CLASS!"
"one of the best professor I\'ve had. Very, Very, very, she didn\'t have to say anything to make me laugh (that funny look on her face gets me all the time). Makes you want to learn and she\'s a pretty easy gader too, so that helps ALOT!"
"He gives assignment with little direction, but shows you a few examples. I didn\'t know anything about computers and to create slides without any help was not the best. I took him over the summer and I got an A."
"DO. NOT. TAKE. Awful. Worst professor I\'ve ever had. Hands down. Incoherent, rambling scribbles on the board, hates students, don\'t ever take him. You\'ll have to take the class over unless you\'re very, very lucky. HUGE WASTE."
"Rao\'s a nice guy, can be humorous & chill. He isn\'t the greatest instructor though. His lectures lack so much clarity. He has typos and makes mistakes while lecturing/explaining things - confusing. He\'s nice and willing to help if you go to his office hours though. But overall do not recommend for a course like this. You need a good clear teacher."
Hard to understand. Nothing was clear. No textbook to back up any of the information. The only hope for a good grade in that class was attendance.
"Dr. Nelsen is a nice guy, if you ever don?t understand something he will help you. He teaches right out of the book which isn?t very helpful. You have to read over every chapter and make sure you understand everything or you won?t do well on the quizzes. The class moves rather fast, you do a full chapter every week but if you read you will do well."
"Dr. Kingan has changed greatly over the past few years. His frustrations in his personal life are apparent in his ensemble teaching and over all attitude. I finished my lesson list last semester, and he stuggled to find me something else to work on. Show up to moves and rehearsals and get an A. You don\'t have to play coherently in juries to pass."
"Smart, smart, smart man. Very kind. He is not an easy grader, but if you do what you\'re supposed to youll be fine. great man"
"He is the easiest-grading professor I\'ve ever had. His teaching style is very chill. His lectures are often unorganized and he may repeat information without realizing it if you don\'t remind him where you left off during your last class period. Definitely a GPA booster. He gives so many opportunities for extra credit, and makes you watch a lot of videos. He\'s also very openly-liberal and enjoys discussing politics. He\'s also kinda funny if there is a person who asks a lot of dumb questions. He\'s not rude, just kinda sassy."
Dr. Kilpack now teaches at BYU and is a great professor. Good lectures and prepares you for the test. She doesn\'t go through the proofs like some professors which is a downfall. Thorough and teaches well.
"Dr. Mangino is an amazing professor. Although she is a rather tough grader, she does force you to become a better writer and does give you the grade you deserve based mainly off of effort. She spends a lot of time grading each paper with helpful feedback. As long as you do all of the required work it is an easy B, but getting an A is a challenge."
She\'s cool! It definitely makes a difference if you participate in class.
"He\'s an experience, to say the least. He is a world-renowned philosopher, and probably one of the most intelligent people alive. His lectures are intense, and you have to keep focus or you will become lost very quickly. He is very willing to help and explain things, though his explanations are very complicated. Too advanced to teach undergrads, IMO"
"She is a great teacher. She is very helpful and understanding. she also gives out lots of extra credit. I had heard a lot of horror stories about the bio lab teachers, and she didn\'t fit into a single one of them. great teacher, and highly recommended."
"Pretty good with discussions, and he was very approachable. Let the class go off in almost any direction the students let it, which actually led to some very interesting talks."
"His class is very easy, he is always helpful if u just stop in his office... but anyone could fall asleep in a class. If you are looking to just get math out of the way.. I highly suggest him. Some studying is needed, but he feeds u the material."
This was a great class. He is very helpful and understandind. His lectures are interesting. He likes to show movies and clips. I would definetly take another one of his classes again. Great Great teacher. Highly recommed it!!
I felt she didnt do that great of teaching. Nothing she taught had examples of it in the book so i had to reteach myself everyday for the homework. she has a very arrogent air about her and kind of intimidating.
"Hard (but fair) grader. Class incorporated a lot of queer theory. Gives very good paper critiques. 50+ pages of academic articles per week, interspersed with a novel once every two weeks and blog posts for every class. Can\'t overstate how heavy the workload was, very challenging class and professor on all counts."
Very hard class. Only given points for tests
"She is a bit eccentric. She grades fairly, if you participate and make appropriate revisions on essays."
bad bad bad teacher.
Probably one of the best professors I have had. Fascinating readings and wonderful at facilitating meaningful discussion.
"Lots of reading, a dificult course, you will learn a lot though. It is valuable info."
"Terrific teacher and grader. As department chair, she teaches you what you need to know, and is an interesting persona too. Take her!"
Great teacher! I definitely thought that the Old Testament might be pretty boring to learn about but Prof. Asen brings up very interesting points in the text and sometimes he\'ll even point out underlying meanings I hadn\'t even noticed during my prior theo classes. I would definitely recommend his class.
"She\'s a pretty good teacher, although she tends to rush through her lessons. She does a good job answering any questions you have. She will throw in a few breaks for you with extra credit and letting you drop your lowest test and quiz grade. BUT! Her final exam practice test is nothing at all like the real final exam, you\'ve been warned."
"WONDERFUL! will have class give each other massages to relax. very engaging and knows his stuff. makes speech assignment clear, and very open to anyones speech topic. makes speaking in front of people less terrifying, and more fun"
"I love Rosendale. He\'s honestly my favorite professor at NAU. His classes are mostly discussions, with a few essays."
"I took WR 121 online with this instructor. The class was easy. We wrote mini essays each week, read from a book and wrote short summaries."
"She is a great person; smart, funny, and helpful. The class is a little difficult, but it is because she is trying to encourage critical thinking. Just remember that to get an A, you have to be outstanding (the way it should be), a B is for sufficient work. The only people who don\'t appreciate this class are those who expect to pass without effort."
"She doesn\'t teach at all. Her projects are from the English department, and when you see them for the first time, she is seeing them for the first time, so don\'t bother asking for clarification on anything as she doesn\'t know anything more than you do."
"Such a great teacher. Have taken him twice with A\'s in both classes. He gives study guides before the tests, which ask the exact questions that will be on the test. He does test reviews and his lectures go through everything on the test, so you don\'t need a book. Great teacher and easy class!!"
Professor Williams is very vauge when asked a question and does not give very concreate instructions. Very short in emails and does not seem to have a great deal of time for troubled students.
"personally, i didn\'t like dr. townsend. he is very judgmental and makes you feel awkward for asking a question. he reads straight from the powerpoints and does not go into detail on important topics. overall, he is one of my least favorite professors."
I totally disagree about the accent part. I didn\'t notice any accent. The professor speaks English very well and I had no difficulties understanding anything he was saying in class.
"YES she is a little crazy, but that is cause she loves what she teaches and understands it. That is a great thing in a teacher. Plus it makes you want to go to class. She can be easy or tare you apart. I can see where some wouldn\'t get along with her but she is one of my favorites!"
"EXTREMELY tough grader. Expects a lot out of his students, but can help a lot with essays. Discussions were fascinating. Doesn\'t emphasize the midterms/finals, cares a lot more about papers. If you want to become a better writer, take his section."
"Not particularly difficult, but assigned work burns a lot of time. Tests are over 3 chapters but open book. No interaction unless there\'s a problem. Syllabus and assignments, and much of the homework is busy work. Required course, so..."
"knows who is sincere and who is not. I found him very helpful and nice. A little sarcastic, but not rude unless blatantly provoked."
This class is a pleasure.
"Professor Parrish is by far one of the best instructors I\'ve ever had at Purdue. Though Lou Kontos is very intelligent, he makes his exams too difficult for just about anyone. Professor Parrish is extremely interesting and so passionate about everything relating to art! He knows his art!!"
I agree. He\'s nasty and makes comments that are not appropriate for a learning environment even if it is college.
A legend in his own mind. UNORGANIZED!!!!!!!!!! Power- hungry. NOT TALENTED!!
Extremely knowledgable teacher. Follow the rules and you will excel. He can tell if you are putting effort into his class. If you aren\'t he doesn\'t care about you.
"Math was not my favorite class in high school, but i understand it really well now because of Mrs. Ouellette. I was worried about the class at first, but she is an awesome teacher. Her notes are easy to understand and her tests are directly from the notes, and extra credit is provided if you are struggling. Take her!!!"
"Summer classes are hard, but DrP gave us many perks to take the pressure off like cheat sheet card for tests. He\'s an RN so was able to relate subject to med field -- made subject even more interesting. College level work is expected but was very helpful in getting us through the tough stuff. One of VC best. Highly recommend!"
"She is the most beautiful professor I\'ve ever had at Penn State. She is so knowledgeable of the course material and explains it very well and thoroughly. She is happy to answer your questions and will do anything to make sure you pass the class. The assignments are all easy and fair, and they don\'t take much time at all."
"Take this class online! It is one of those I think is definitely worth not going to lecture. There is a lot of chemistry and biology, if you take those classes first you will have a huge advantage. Aced this class and she was a great instructor!"
"Prof. Finkel is honestly one of the best. Her lectures are extremely interesting and she always goes out of her way to ensure the success of her students. Although I did okay on the first midterm, I aced both the final and the paper and manage to get an A in the end. The textbook is also optional since she lectures from it. Memorize everything!"
"I am having a HORRIBLE experience in his class. It takes 3 weeks to over a month for him to grade written assignments, which are due every week. So each week you\'re blindly writing without direction. When he does finally grade the work, he offers no feedback. Most of his instruction is vague, left open to your interpretation, but he grades hard"
"She\'s really nice and a Great professor. I took her for an online course but there is lots of online work that you have to do, and you have to read a lot for it."
He\'s the stupidest teacher ever..can\'t speak english well and can\'t do math either..so many times he had the wrong answer to a problem but yet he insisted it was right... then he makes up some stupid excuse as to why it was wrong.dumba$$
Very sweet lady but does not explain the content very well and speeds through things quickly. The overall grade is 80% exams.
"An outstanding professor who still cares that her students get a high quality education, one with a solid foundation, Dr. Ivers also has a great sense of humor. She challenges, but rewards, as well."
"STUDY EVERYTHING ON THE LECTURE SLIDES, equations, graphs, and words in color or noncolored are possible questions on the exam. Make sure you understand the how to do the old exam, which is provided to you! THEN IT WILL BE EASY A! i think the whole class wanna know who grades the HW! I stopped going to class too cuz too cold and early!"
He asks rediculous questions in class and expects you to answer them. He will ask a question and then wait...and wait...and wait until someone says something. He also makes people do presentations to make up for his lack of teaching. He seems very well versed in his field but just not an effective teacher.
"this class was difficult and i didn\'t learn that much. he put too much of his own ideological ""spills"" into his lectures, which I found annoying. he is good-looking though."
No matter how much you work you are not going to get an A. Please avoid this guy.
Very funny. Doesn\'t post any notes. It\'s your responsibility to take notes. Only 3 tests and the final was NOT cumulative!!!!!!!!! Definitely worth taking
VERY GOOD TEACHER!!! Wish she was still here
I completely agree with other comment from 3015. He is a good guy and keeps the class engaged but he is a harsh grader (I\'m sure to prep you for the upper level spanish) but he does not provide enough explanation to fix the papers. You need to do the readings in the class otherwise you will fail.
"Just wanted to react to the person who said she was bad... If you can\'t recognize a good teacher from a bad one, well you have nothing to do at the U. Anita is wonderful, tries everything she can to make you learn without beeing boring... She\'s always smiling, nice and helpful. I would recommend her anytime."
"having her as my professor has raised a lot of questions on my mind as to what characteristics do you need to become a professor and i have came to conclusion that if she can be my professor anyone can be a professor , a professor is meant to encourage and award their students not put them down"
"TAKE HIM! He really cares and you will learn a lot. 2 tests are challenging but you can get 20pt extra credit on each if you watch movies. curves and only takes attendance on Fridays. If you put the effort in, you can easily get an A. He is very understanding and intelligent. don\'t buy the text used only for maps and reference just go to blackwell"
Great instructor. I was upset she wasn\'t teaching the next math course when I needed it. She is one of my favorite college professors ever. I highly recommend.
"Dr. Baggett\'s (Dr. Vitulli) passion for art ed. is contagious; however, her inadequacies overshadow that passion. She assigned artwork, and never looked at it (what kind of example is she setting?). I am walking away from the class with very little information/resources to support art education. She\'s also apathetic when it comes to grading."
"this class is annoying. for non-science majors, but with all the work"
"I took her GIS2040 online. I had trouble with the book I bought used and was on trip, it took me 3 weeks to come around a new one, she let me catch up with all late assigts, also very quick to answer emails and work with your issues. Class is mostly about working with ArcGis SW and mapping, follow instructs. you\'ll be ok, working hard get you an A"
"Ron always replies to emails quickly and gave so many opportunities for extra credit. There were a few times he randomly took attendance, but you could even make that grade up with extra credit if you missed the class day. Just study the powerpoints he posts online before the tests. There\'s an optional non-cumulative final that helped my grade."
She just wants to see all of her students pass. Ask her questions and she WILL help you.
"awesome teacher! super chill, fun personality. always energetic and ready to teach. she makes class really fun."
"Prof. King is very kind and helpful I loved her class. You have to put an effort to get an A. She lets you resubmit your paper and that was very helpful. I learned so much from her class, definitely taking her again."
Best class ever
"WORST PROFESSOR I HAVE EVER HAD! She doesn\'t teach anything, she expects you to teach yourself. Her grading is impossible. I followed her exact specifications, showed up everyday and put in countless hours of work in and still got a C. She told the class that some people had NO TALENT whatsoever; but most people can\'t see through her fake exterior."
As long as you have someone sign you in you are golden. tests are all on D2L. all super easy.
He is great. He made feel confident about writing.
"Kaplan is a wonderful professor and person. Very talented and insightful with historical context to math. I recommend solo-UGR with him. Group UGR\'s are difficult as he does not mediate other people\'s effort well. Your peers tend to be very distant from the group. Also, his office hours are packed and schedule 150% full. Always on the run."
"Tells stories & puts you in scenarios to illustrate principles. Seems to go off on strange tangents, ends up with a deliberate point. The paper will kill you, start early, show him part of it for feed back. I had to rewrite mine at the last minute, got an A. Participation is encouraged, you actually get to think. Best teacher I ever had, fun class."
very good
"This teacher is terrible. She is incredibly dull, and does not seem to know what she is talking about half the time. She is one of those teachers who likes it when you agree with her opinion. Dont take this class unless you want to be bored to tears."
"First of all, he is very unclear and on top of that, he is very stubborn.I have heard him making fun of the Hispanic students with some other students. If you are a hispanic student, then you do not want to take his class. I enrolled in his class in Jan 2006 and he has been giving me a very hard time. He is also very rude and obnoxsious."
Simply Does not know how to communicate with those who are struggling with concepts. Talks for nearly 2 hours straight assuming everyone gets it. Not comfortable answering questions. Not available. Takes forever responding to emails if at all. GPA killer.
"Loved taking Dr. Campbell\'s class, would absolutely do it again. Do not take this class if you are not prepared to put in the effort. Also, write the paper."
best class ever
"Hewett is one of the few professors who wants to make you actually think and apply things. He is much better in upper level courses with students who actually know something and care about economics. He said if we truly made an effort in his class, he\'d guarantee us a B, which he followed through on. He can be very confusing but knows his stuff."
Excellent professor. Makes accounting easy to understand. You will work hard in this class but you end up learning a lot.
Came here before signing up and the exams and not easy/fair... the multichoice is REALLY hard and could be based on any one unimportant sentence in the 300 plus pages of content for test. Written based on main concepts though and evens it out. Only take if you REALLY want to. She is quiet and a bit boring. TA marks fast and well. Text entensive.
She is the best teacher I ever had. You will learn from her not only English. She teaches you to be a good teacher too.
"annoying, narrow-minded, got an A+ from using her opinion on everything in my assignments. Has stupid discussions like, ""what is peace, really?"" and does not except any opinion but her own. Do not disagree with her, pretend you like Michael Moore, and put your hand up in class and you will get an A. stear clear"
Why does she teach? If the overall class average is 70-something percent... doesn\'t it tell you that the class needs a better way of learning? I hate teachers that can\'t answer questions and that doesn\'t expect more from a smart group of students.
"There is never really a point where he officially starts his lectures he literally just starts talking and never stops talking until the lecture is over. We watch a film a week; some are good, most are terrible . We have three assignments a week along with the movie and I never feel like I learn anything from them."
"She was the worst English teacher I have ever had. I have gotten A\'s in English my whole life, and I have always been told that I am a good writer. She is unclear and difficult to work with. I will get an A, but it is so time consuming. I have never worked so hard in an English class, and no assignment has really TAUGHT me anything."
Great professor. Knows his stuff. Favorite at Pitt State.
"I love Rigsby! She\'s a great person and so enthusiastic about the subject. She\'s really willing to listen to new ideas and is pretty standard on her grading. I\'ve heard she plays favorites, but I think she just rewards good class participation. If you read, go to class, and try to understand, she\'ll be willing to help you succeed."
"I liked this professor alot. He gives lots of extra credit work. You do have to read the book to pass the exams. make sure you take lots of notes, very helpful. funny and very nice."
"GREAT PROFESSOR. WHAT YOU SEE IT\'S WHAT YOU GET. IF YOU DON\'T STUDY HOW YOU EXPECT TO GET A GOOD GRADE.HE\'S FAIR AND HONNEST. ALSO HE CURVES THE GRADES. ""C"" CAN TURN TO AN ""B\'."
Okay class. Knows his stuff but he is arrogant and rude. Doesn\'t return emails and if he does. Expect 1 -2 words
"You want to like her, but it\'s so hard. She\'s really nice and tries to be helpful, but it can\'t make up for the incredibly confusing and harried lectures, and unpredictable and untaught test questions."
"Professor Koenig was often late for class, unprepared, and the Powerpoints posted online were different from the ones she presented in class. Many of the concepts are unclear and she seems uninterested in the class. She teaches like Zelazo! She is very nice but not a quality teacher."
"Do not take this class with Prof. Rose! He may be ""goofy"", but lacks the essentials to teach a college level English Class, let alone a High school class. Find another instructor who cann teach you the skills to write a good essay paper. Also his ""ghost editor"" is terrible, if you have any problems with this ""pencil Person"" just talk to him, or go"
the greatest teacher ever!
the nicest woman i have ever met in my life. she smiles alot and is very happy all the time. that is a good thing.
"Mrs. Lally is extremely helpful. She makes you work, but she is more than willing to work with you. Take her if you want to learn-this isn\'t high school anymore. She is big on following directions and giving examples of what she expects."
"Funny, but useless prof. Just read the book. You don\'t even need to show up to class."
She always late for class at least 15 minutes without explaination. She is a hard marker and unfair teacher. Worst teacher in my life.
"I found her to be a lot more friendly and lenient compared to the other professors at Kwantlen, Attendance is required to get a good grade for the lab portion as she gave daily quizzes. Her lecture exam was really easy but the lab exam was extremely difficult because of her marking and was worth double at 30% . Didn\'t use the textbook much."
All the negative reviews are right.. She is such a bad teacher. Useless
"If you don\'t have a friend in an earlier discussion class, be prepared to fail the quizzes. Tests are based off his slides though, so if you wrote all that down, you\'ll be okay. Pretty monotone guy but as the semester progressed he grew on me and if you speak up in class he\'s not too bad."
Do anything you can to avoid this instructor. He is a very intelligent man but cannot tech anyone anything. He is hard of hearing and asks questions of the class which he cannot hear the answer to. Then wh he thinks the class is nto answeringhe raises his vic.
He\'s really nice but expects you to know your material. He makes the long lectures bearable with humor and the thing that I appreciated the most was that he relates the material that were learning to the outside world with real life examples. This made learning in this class straight forward for me. There\'s always opportunities for extra credit to
"Simply put, Mrs. Tackabury has made the biggest impact of any other teacher I\'ve ever learned from! There\'s no other teacher who will believe in you more than her! Take ever class she offers."
"Great teacher. Friendly and approachable. Explains material well, willing to email and answer questions or give advice. Learned A LOT. Dont be affraid of public speaking. He is funny and doesnt require a book. Write the speeches, show up, memorize them and your good!"
she doesnt give exams!
"Lectures have nothing to do with the course at all. You will see something for the first time on the exam. He takes attendance, and he has strong opinions, and if you don\'t agree with him he will argue back with you like a 5 year old. If you have a question he makes you feel dumb about it and wont give you a clear answer. Tons of EC, and a paper."
"great professor. do all of the extra credit, he is a tough grader on assignments but offers tons of xtra credit. felt like i learned a lot in his class. only complaint is him making you memorize everyones name in class, spent way too much class time on that. great lectures, fun homework assignments, wants you to learn. gets you to participate."
"Very Difficult course. Do not take it if you are just fulfilling a G.E.. Only take it if you LOVE jazz and/or already know a lot of jazz history. Akagi does not curve, and his TAs are hard graders. He makes this class as hard as a science, and not all people can listen to a song composed of random noises and know the title, composer, performers,etc"
"I think he was pretty great. The class itself wasn\'t all that phenomenal, but I had a death in my family and a grandma with cancer whom I had to visit frequently in the hospital; because of those hardships I probably missed about 4 classes and 1 midterm. He was so understanding and compassionate and ready to do anything to accomodate me. Great man."
Freaking hilarious
Sherman is a very very hard teacher. She makes you earn an A. you gotta attend every class and every open lab to have a chance in the class.
She REALLY made Newswriting a horrible experience for me... she is no ver helpful and her mind will wonder. She seriously makes you waste paper and time...I know folks who also took this class at the same time and it was ten times easier than hers.
"Halog\'s time needs to be over! This man is way beyond his prime and is doing more than just a few major disservices to the college and, in effect, the community. Besides the fact that he is a notorious chain-smoker with a bad attitude, he should have no say over learning today because he is 857 years old. Get rid of Halog!"
Horrible.
"It\'s hard to describe the bond our class developed with him- we had him for four consecutive courses (ASL 1,2,3,4), and he was almost like a father figure to us. Just a great guy; really cares about students."
Fr. Anselm is a very good teacher. He knows the subject matter and is very interested in making sure his students understand the material.
don\'t take her class
"Amazing professor, lectures are good. However grading is hard. You can loose about 15 points to get an A and its easy to loose points on the exam. You need to go beyond the study guides for exams and really understand all application of concepts/read parts of the book. Class content itself isnt difficult at all but just wish A was easier"
"Unlike a number of the people who have reviewed her, I really enjoyed Dr. Pivarski\'s teaching. Maybe her style is better for lower-level math; she made precalculus very clear, graded quite forgivingly, and enhanced my interest in the subject. Everyone in my class really seemed to like her. Go figure."
"BEST teacher I\'ve ever had. Very clear and interesting. He truly cares about the students. His tests are fair and he gives you all his notes to study from. He makes the class interesting and told some funny stories. I wish I could have him for some more classes. He caughs alot from all the smoking, but he\'s a great guy,it\'s funny after awhile"
"Overall, this is a pretty straight forward English 1 course. Make sure read for the quizzes, (which were easy if you read)the writing assignments for the corresponding sections, a fair job on all of her essays (the ad analysis, response, and research papers) and attend class everyday and you should have no problem getting at least a B like I did."
"It\'s not his fault that this is a dreadfully boring course, and he\'s doing the best he can to keep people interested. Goes through examples such there\'s absolutely no ambiguity on the assignments."
"Great teacher. Tough exams, but he grades fairly, even goes so far as to grade the scratch sheets! His courses make you learn allot of stuff, and you learn them very well."
"Easy class, but he speaks so softly that if someone zippers their backpack you missed his entire explanation. You have to read the book to learn it yourself because he doesn\'t really teach. Posts answers to tests online before the exam is given, quizzes are extremely easy."
"professional writer, talented, ... hot..."
"He doesn\'t really teach you anything, all the examples are from the book. I mean if you ask him a question he\'ll help you,but i think he\'s one of those professors who knows his stuf so well he can\'t teach it. Real bad with returning e-mails. Make sure you do ALL your homework,it\'s 50% of your grade"
"Terrible professor, she is never clear about anything ever. She changes her mind about everything and never lets you know what she is looking for. Avoid at all costs"
This was one of my favorite classes taken so far here at UD. Very good for history/philosophy/humanities majors interested in broadening their knowledge of the world and its landscapes. Is not a typical geog class but in very interesting in that it teaches you to think abstractly. Do the readings and pay close attention to everything he says.
"She is adorable and very easy. It will not take much to pass, attendance is mandatory 50% of grade. 4 easy tests and one gets dropped. Do your reading and pay attention so you wont have to write a paper. Heard shes retiring though, if so, you guys missed out."
"Strond is a great professor. Yes his tests/quizzes are all cumulative, but that just makes you study everyday (like you\'re supposed to...) and helps you retain the knowledge. Very easy to get an A in the class if you pay attention in class and watch his lecture videos (sometimes in class he covers things that aren\'t in the videos)."
She\'s SO annoying. Enough said.
If she asks for a signed \'learning plan\' DONT.Get a 2nd opinion/instructor ASAP.
"""alls it is"" watch out for her catch phrase she uses it often. Overall all easy class. Show up to every class, and genuinely pay attention in class. Avoid falling asleep during the Bio psychology part of the psychology course and you will do just fine. This teacher gave out enough xtra credit to boost my grade 3 points at the end of the semester."
She is absolutely awesome I definitely recommend her.
She blabs a lot. Not that interesting. VERY scattered ex: didn\'t remember her own instructions for the exam. Not a very hard class but you wont get a lot out of it.
"Seriously... give her more credit. Keep in mind the people teaching this class are grad students and it is their first year teaching, it\'s not easy with 140 students. I really enjoyed her class and I learned something new and cool everyday. She did the best she could explaining things, it\'s called reading the book and taking notes. Tests were hard."
Very kind professor and does her best to keep the class engaged. Sometimes she sways off topic and then some days she goes on forever about a topic. Her lectures get lengthy and she shows lots of clips. Participation counts and helps move the class along. I never used the book as she gives handouts. grading is tough but you don\'t have many papers.
She is not a bad prof. always held more office hours than needed. One can easily score really well in her class.
"Dr. Higley is a great guy, but not great at teaching. His lectures are all over the place and he always try to tie in the gospel but it doesn\'t work and should be left out at times. There are weekly tests, and the chapters you read are extremely long. Attendance is mandatory, but honestly what he says in lecture won\'t help you on the tests at all."
"He is a teacher that is there to help the students that want to learn, and not so good with the slackers. Overall good teacher and is one that I do recommend for these that are willing to learn, by actually practicing and doing the work."
"Best teacher. He makes everything easy (which is why i clicked easy) IF you go to every class, do the hw, youll get an A. The way he teaches makes everything EASY. Seriously. Must take any class he teaches. Youll end this class understanding the subject completely. Favorite teacher."
"In 1 word; USELESS! Thank God I had a prior knowledge of the material. I was very excited to take the course and fine tune my financial statement analysis skills, but we didn\'t cover anything regarding financial statement analysis. On top of all that this man is one of the most arrogant people I have ever come across in my life. Avoid at all costs!"
Hard but nice guy
"He gives you guidelines of what he thinks he wants for papers then somehow changes his mind midway through reading them, which makes it near impossible to get a good grade"
"I liked Acker. He was clever, funny, and helped you understand the material *in class*. That said, cutting class was hard because his notes are unhelpful and hard to read and the texts are largely unnecessary. But that said, I miss the fun of being in his class. Undoubtedly, Acker will make you interested in geography."
"This professor is the smartest man, but he doesn\'t teach you the material. He expects you to show up to his office everyday. If you ask to see how something is done in order to get it right on the daily quizzes he will change the quiz so it\'s something different that you also don\'t know how to do. The curve is the only way the class passed."
"Do not recommend her if you do not like to write. Assigns an essay every week and is very unclear with the prompt. If you ask her a question, all she will say is to find it in the syllubus. She is also very weird. Not a friendly teacher by any means."
"Doesnt use a textbook frequently, but does have a required novel."
He cracks me up. Very funny and good. Funky hair.
"Just do the extra credit and it will raise you a letter grade. I finished with a grade above 100, but it was recorded with a 100. D:"
He is a great professor the only problem is that I have him for a 9:30 class and that part can be rough. If you don\'t study for his test it can be difficult but he is very generous on the curve I received about a 50 on my first exam and it was curved up to a 75. I strongly recommend taking him and he encourages his students to ask questions.
He is the cutest man ever! So funny and really tries his best to help you in any way he can. Gives learning objectives for every test. Quizzes every day but have unlimited attempts so its an easy A in the class for extra credit. Participation matters!!!!!!!
"Honestly, I don\'t know what the complaints were about the class. Sure, the tests were extremely detailed but they were curved highly, essay grades followed the rubric given to the students. If you go to lecture and discussion, it\'s really easy to get an a in the class without even reading the book... just pay attention and study hard for the tests."
She is one of the best teachers you will ever have at NYU. She knows what she is talking about and will push you and challenge you.
awesome teacher!! i would love to continue japanese language study with her!
best professor ever
Good prof.
"I was not alone in my dislike for Dr. Tanner. The entire class was left confused and usually hopeless by the end of it all. Tanner does not set a clear schedule, does not set clear guidelines, and expects near perfection. I would seriously avoid this class. Average grade on papers was a C- and said that he grades tough to motivate you."
"Dr. Burnaby is passionate re her work and that made it interesting for me. The course, however, needs work on its structure and what its purpose is. Many students struggled."
"Pro. Jackson is very kind, patient, and helpful. All classwork/ homework is basic and simple, quizzes are done with a partner, and one test (final exam). She\'s always available and her experience will guide anyone to the next level. This class is a guaranteed ""A"" and a non-regret."
"He is very liberal and thinks he is 5 times smarter than einstein but he is a great teacher. He also kept me interested, I never fell asleep one time. He tells a lot of relative stories that keep your attention and help you understand the reading assignments. Overall, I recommend him to everyone!"
"Gotta love Girasa. He\'s smart, nice and interesting. You can learn many things from this man. Pay attention to the stories because they help you to understand the laws by putting them into everyday situations."
I thought she was a great prof! You do have to go to class. I hated poetry before this class but she actually made it enjoyable. You do have to do your work and study but you\'re in college now. You should do those things anyway. She is very fair and explains how she grades up front. Loved her!
Always be prepared for class. She\'s really nice and understanding if you make an effort to ask for help on assignments (USE HER WEDNESDAY OFFICE HOUR). Gives really good feedback on essays. Does not tolerate tardiness. Lots of writing but only 2-3 pages long. Final essay will be 6-8 pages long and shortly presented in class. Really not that bad.
"Dr. Petrie is an awesome professor! You get out of it what you put into it. If you come to class willing to learn and put forth the effort, he is going to help you succeed. I don\'t understand why people comment about him not answering questions. He answers all questions, and is very nice about it. He is very witty, and has a great sense of humor!"
"Professor Owens isn\'t kidding when he says he puts his heart and soul into teaching it. Those willing to deal with his somewhat eccentric teaching style, a good deal of reading, etc. are bound to learn much from him. Always available for Q & A."
She is very Helpful! this class is way to easy TAKE HER CLASS
Great designer and instructor. And she\'s extremely funny.
easiest A-. and my first A- at baruch. best professor ever. highly recommended. just close ur eyes andpick this professor=no regrets at the end of semester. if u can\'t get A- or B+ in his class u suck and u\'re retarded. simply just awesome and funny and care about his students and curves each exam. and he even cancelled the final to curve our grade
"What a fun prof! Roberto provides great feedback for Photoshop projects and is very passionate about life, photography, and art! Be prepared to ask questions until you understand what he is wanting you to accomplish. He is a brilliant man, and HOT!"
"His course was brutal. 30% first midterm, 30% second midterm, 25% final. I studied so hard and still am not going to end with a good grade - extremely disappointing considering I want to major in Econ now. I totally understand everything, but the way his tests are (50 multiple choice) don\'t reflect what you learned, just how well you can memorize."
"No textbook, but assigned readings are LONG and most boring. He says summaries can be short, but I\'ve found they have to be long to get a good grade. That\'s the hardest part. I actually enjoyed lectures, because he\'s passionate, and he talks politics, though politics is unrelated. Tests are really easy, since it\'s all open-book. He\'s friendly."
"Why is this person called a professor? this is basically a put-down machine with a liscense to make others feel inferior ..and gets paid for it?Plays favourites, and pretends to know how to paint...no interest in students who share an advisor. BAD BAD BAD vibes from a mean minded person...and no room for anyone who differs in opinion."
"worst class i have ever taken. the teacher was incompetent forced students to participate. learned absolutely nothing, projects were useless. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS, dreaded going to every single class. should really review before rehiring."
"Garcia is DA MAN. such a fun, funny, sarcastic, interesting person. don\'t take him if you are sensitive or get offended easily. the guy\'s as sharp as it gets. Made math classes surprisingly fun to attend. math 7 isn\'t easy, but he makes it seem not that bad."
He\'s awful. He\'s rude and not helpful at all.
"ps He is an amazing professor who is extremely knowledgeable but the pop quizzes are ridiculous. Little time to take the quizzes and if you don\'t put the exact answer you won\'t do well. As for the midterm, the grading was not fair what so ever. Maybe it was the GSIs, but if you can try to avoid this class."
Very boring. Assigns work out of 3 different books.
had her for speech and theatre history.. she\'s awesome! very helpful and easy to follow.. interesting too!
"Like any other nursing class this one was not easy. Mrs. Garcia was a great teacher. She expects you to know the material in clinical, and be prepared to study. Just passed my NCLEX in Jan. Thank you Mrs. Garcia!!!!! K. S."
"This was one of the most overall helpful courses I have taken, and it will change the way I do research for all future classes. The professor was professional, timely with grading, helpful, and made the class feel easy, even though some of the quizzes were a little tricky. Ms. Wolk gave a reasonable amount of work for learning the material."
"I had a great time with this professor. Although it is true that we fly through material in class, if you take the time to watch the videos provided and study, you will easily succeed in this class. I would recommend watching all the videos for homework and studying often. With hard work, it\'s an easy class."
Math is my least favourite subject but Edward was hilarious and although the lectures can be pretty dry (it is math) he tried to give us some background knowledge to teach us the why\'s instead of just do this because you get the answer. I believe it would be hard to not finish this class without at least an 80. Put in a bit of effort easy 90.
"Loved the class and I loved her. She really likes to get to know everyone and you get to know the other students as well. Make a lot of friends and have a lot of fun. We got to write out own monolouges and the final scene wasn\'t hard. She is easy to talk to and wants to see you succeed. One written test, not hard at all."
terrible teacher
"Ms. Cook is a little OUT THERE, but her class is entertaining. You will not learn much if you don\'t read the book yourself. No homework and the tests are straight out of the book. She will single people out at times."
"she is so nice and so helpful. she really knows what she is taking about and her enthusiasm makes class fly by. keep up with reading and she will recap and explain everything. quizzes are a gift, drops ur lowest one. tests are easy and she takes feedback seriously. def take!!!"
A good guy with a strong Army background. Very social and gives great lectures that are engaging.
"Great teacher, when you need help her office is always open. She reply\'s to e-mails fast."
"She\'s tough and definitely has favorites, but she gets through a lot of material and gives you a basic understanding of it. Very difficult class though."
"She is very rude and disrespectful. She will talk down to you and expect you to know how to do everything she says. The way she grades makes absolutely no sense, and when you ask her questions she acts offended. Worst professor I\'ve ever had."
"French Rev&Napoleon was best class I\'ve taken at IUP and she is by far my favorite professor! I would recommend her to anyone. The most intelligent person I\'ve ever met & has sincere care for students. Some writing assignments are difficult, and MUST read the book.If you keep up with notes readings & material all semester,short essay exams are easy"
Definitely one of my favorite professors. He made classes really fun and interesting! He brings in interesting guest speakers so you really get to apply what you learn to real life.
"Ok, I used to be a math major, and wasn\'t that bad at it... but ended up with a 63% in his ECON math course. Something seems a little wrong with that. Bad for people who don\'t want to follow all of his rules, and who know how to do the stuff a better way already."
"She\'s a great professor. Shes ALWAYS willing to help you. You have to read the text book and pay attention in class, as well as save/use all hand outs she gives you in order to do well. The assignments were never extremely hard, she\'ll help you if you\'re having a really hard time. Very good course :) I recommend it!"
"Love this guy, he\'s always been there to help me out not only with his classes but with other classes as well. Fun time in his class always!"
"She is the worst teacher I have experienced in the MGMT department. Once a week she speeds through a lecture from a chapter in the book and SPEED reads directly from her powerpoint. The other day, she uses to do case analysis from outside readings. She is extremely ambiguous as to what she expects from the class and IS AN EXTREMELY HARD GRADER."
do not take this guy
"Dr. Wilma Parker has great generosity, knowledge, experience and respectable personality as a professor. I was inspired a lot during my class."
excellent !
WORST PROFESSOR EVER. STAY AWAY FROM HER CLASS. Teaches like her students are morons. Refuses to help with problems if you don\'t understand. Extremely rude. The only good thing is she shows your grades at the end of every week. STAY FAR AWAY FROM THIS WOMEN!
This class prepared me for the State of Michigan test. He focuses on terms and graph reading. Relates to real world situations on minumum wage and presidential elections. I He is a liberal.
"Gives only feedbacks never explains. Wont even teach, most of her lecture consist of her explaining what she wants for the homework. Doesnt use canvas. Never clear"
"Dr. Hanlan was a very nice prof and seemed to genuinely care about her students, however her lectures were sometimes very fast pace and her explanations were often unclear. Would definitely recommend thoroughly working through lon capa assignments to get a good understanding. Tutorials were not mandatory however I found them to be helpful."
Love You Stacy...
Dr. Douglas is a fantastic and inspiring professor. This was my favorite class at UNCG.
She knows her stuff
I took this class for a elective.. I learned some much... He is one of the nicest teachers\' at LSCC. Take the time to get to know him. You will do great.. He puts the C in caring.... Kedhe on the other hand puts the F in Fail..
darlington is the WORST teacher I have ever had. I personally asked her for help on multiple occasions and she did not even listen to me. She just ignored me and told me to look at my notes. I hardly ever missed her class and I was still lost.
"The book sucks! the only reason we used it is because she wrote it. other than that the class was ok. I use the information in other classes that I learned in ""Thinking and Reasoning"""
"Worst teacher I\'ve had so far at GPC. She is incredibly unorganized and not very helpful, not to mention boring. She grades the assignments with these weird scores and never really tells you why she is taking off points. Horrific teacher."
She is simply wonderful! I could listen to her for hours. Very interesting class.
Laura\'s stats class is very easy and I liked her generally as she\'s far better than the alternatives. She\'s a boring lecturer and not always very clear but it usually ends up being fine for us. The class involved a sizable amount of work and a final group project but everything was doable. Class averages were usually pretty high too.
"I have taken Girasa for bus150 and buslaw, he is an awesome professor! He was in the military, is an amazing lawyer and prof he taught in different countries! and even wrote the first book on cyber law! I wish to even accomplish half of what he has and ill die happy.. I just wish he wrote an autobiography!!!"
this is the most boring class you could ever take. prior to class i did not know much about poli sci so i decided to check it out. well let\'s just say that i wouldn\'t go back.
GREAT PROFESSOR!!! He made the subject even more interesting than I tought it would be. He really loves what he teaches and that reflects on his lectures. I highly recommend his class to anyone.
I love this guy! He\'s the best teacher to take if you\'re not good at math.\r He has a great sense of humor and keeps class laughing even about Math. I have never comprehended Algebra like I have in the 0012 and 0024 with him as my Professor. I just wish he taught the next classes I have to take for Math.For you own good DO NOT MISS a class
"Dawson is an unusual creature: having put the effort into creating a new type of course in 325, one would expect him to act like he cares a bit more. This is not the case. The man\'s a walking sleeping draught, and the work is so tedious it makes me break down in tears."
"Very easy to understand in class and explains things very well if you ask questions. Tests aren\'t too hard, just pace yourself. Homework assignments are very long, however and are sometimes very hard too."
"So sweet and helpful. He needs a girlfriend, though."
"Frustrating is all I can say, does not use dc connect, never posts anything, No idea what will be on a test"
Test are tough. His lectures for perception were very interesting. hes just very strict with exams and if you dont study it is hard. But he curved a lot. I would have failed the class if I he didnt curved. Exams were 33 questions. at first we only had 30 min to take it but then students protested to make it atleast 50 min.
"Edgar is the MAN. He is an excellent teacher who goes out of his way to prepare you for success. His lectures are clear, his notes outstanding, he is incredibly patient and always happy to clarify and answer questions. By far the best math professor at Langara, I highly, highly recommend him. If I could take all of my math classes with him I would."
Mr. Christian is a great teacher. His class is very interesting and he explains concepts very well.
She amazing. Best class I\'ve taken at SLCC so far.
Professor Cummings is a down to earth woman. Her powerpoints and exam questions come straight from online sources so it isn\'t hard to get a good grade in her class. She loves to apply her lessons to the real world (as it should be). Overall I had her for 201 and 202 and would love to take her again in the future.
"Dr. Bartee was extremely helpful. If at any point you feel you are falling behind, email him! I\'ve taken two courses with him, and hope to have many more!"
The syllabus says there\'s a required text but that is a typo! Don\'t buy it! You have to put in a lot of time to work on projects outside of class. I had to cut back my hours at work to make time for this class! Quizzes are really hard and everyone does bad but he curves the grades so you end up doing better than you expected. AWESOME TEACHER!FUNNY!
"Wonderful prof, and the sweetest man ever! By far my favorite at GVSU!"
"Monica is one of my favorite teachers at Geneseo. She is so passionate and understanding. If you want an A... go to class, take good notes, read the parts of the text she tells you and combine them with your class notes. She also gives extra credit! She honestly wants you to do well and I learned a lot from her. I cannot recommend her enough!!!"
He is just excellent and very knowledgeable!
"Professor was disorganized and unclear on assignments. Hard to prepare for class lectures. Many last minute emails/updates given on weekends prior to class the following week. Although accessible outside of class, one-on-one meetings were not the most productive/helpful. Quizzes and assignments heavily based on lecture, hardly used text books"
"Sunshine is an amazing professor/counselor.She is very informative and clear with what to do to achieve your goals.This class was a HUGE help for me picking a major and writing my ed plan to get my degree.If you\'re a slacker/stoner type she will call you out, and be on time! Didn\'t need to buy the book.Do your work and you get an A! She\'s great!"
Raza is a nice person but not a great teacher. His lectures are reading off slides with no explanations. Willing to answer questions but usually answers by restating what was on his slides . Homework was easy but did require working for the grade. His Final is worth 40 % of you grade. The average for the class was a 70 % which was not passing.
Eva was a good lecturer. She was clear about topics and was good and thorough when answering questions. She never really showed her personality so if you\'re looking for a charismatic lecturer I wouldn\'t take her course. The content is kind of difficult to understand but if you go to your discussion sessions and ask questions and study it\'s doable.
She really knows the stuff and her way of solving questions is very smart but takes time to understand. Very helpful prof. overall :)
Teacher was smart and helpful
"Under no circumstances should you sign up for his lectures. He clearly does not know how to explain concepts. More than half of the class is spent on his life stories, which are not close to being funny ( he thinks they are hilarious). Will not wish anyone to have a lecturer like him ever."
"Douglas is a great professor who is very passionate about what she teaches. Her class is interesting and fun, and if you come to class everyday, very easy to get an A. Definitely recommend her."
"Andy Lane rocks. Ignore all the haters out there, this guy is one of the more serious film profs at NCSA. First years tend not to dig him, because they\'re looking for thrills, and he has a quiet, dry sense of humor, but his advice on my films has been the most useful of any film prof. I\'m a directing upperclassman, so I know. He\'s best one on one."
"very good teacher, my favorite class"
"Fairly good teacher, gives good advice. Very nice and easy to get along with, very down to earth guy"
"This teacher is absolutely atrocious! He literally said the first day of class- ""what brings him the most joy is failing people!"" He actually wanted people to drop the class so he wouldn\'t have as much work to do. What kind of a teacher is that?!"
"Awesome guy, tough grader"
Took this 8-week online class. The structure of the class is a bit chaotic. No exam due dates. The lack of structure causes confusion since there is A TON of difficult reading. You will need to turn in an assignment weeks before you get to that unit. Exams are challenging. Exams are 30 multiple choice questions based on 3 chapters of material.
"Attendance is mandatory, you will not pass if you don\'t show up. Lectures are long, but not relative to tests. Tests are not in relation to content covered in her lectures. Would not be surprised if she got her tests off the internet. Study guides are useless, don\'t cover what will be on the test."
"Attended her class two times and said I need out! Not a nice women, and doesnt use appropriate language. Does not help her student in any way.NOT A FUN CLASS!"
I took his BA322 class online and was very happy with the outcome. Easy A. All test questions are out of the study guides he gives you on Angel. Very good material to read. I suggest him for anything he teaches.
"Dr. Ahmadi is hilarious. He makes a very boring class seem very interesting. I have him for a night class and he makes the 2 hours and 40 minutes fly by. He lets us out early every week, also. I definitely recommend taking him over anyother Econ teacher."
"What can I say about this math class... it is bad. Eileen Katz is the kind of person that is a genius with the material but cannot explain it. I had to use the book to back-up everything she ""taught."" She helps a bit, but you have to be responsible and learn most of it on your own."
"She is a nice lady, but not fair in her grading. I did well on my quizzes all year, and then at exam time, because some people weren\'t doing well, they meant nothing. A year\'s worth of studying wasted!And then the exam was hard so I went from 90\'s to 70"
"Dr. Jeffery Smith is the most amazing teacher at Glendale Community College. Dr. Smith is very helpful and the information that he gives are very useful. He is very easy to communicate, and very friendly. I recommend taking his class."
This class is extrememly boring. Some of his exams are really hard but overall he is an ok professor if you can stay awake.
"Easiest, most laid back teacher ever. She gives A\'s on everything as long as you make your time in speeches. She also gives a lot of extra credit!"
She\'s a good teacher to listen to but you\'ll need to put in the extra effort to learn most of the material yourself.
"This prof\'s classes tend to be rather boring as he drones on, essentially just reading off of his slides (which have way too much writing on them). His testing was not a fair assessment of our knowledge seeing as we needed to know what exact words were missing in excerpts from the readings, and which characters said the obscure quotes given."
cares about her students!
"When I took this class, I thought he must be a brand new teacher because he was so unorganized and seemed to teach this class like he didn\'t know what he was doing. I was very surprised to learn that he had been teaching this class for years. He didn\'t seem to care if we learned anything or not. I don\'t remember ever having a teacher this bad."
"I took this class a few years ago, but loved it!!!! He is definitely one of the best teachers I have ever had."
I love Boniface! He is very honest and straightforward. Always makes sure he is being fair and keeping the class interested. One of the best teachers ive ever had.
online class is very easy. simply read the chapter and take the quiz. writing assignment once a week and they are SO EASY. all work is posted ahead of time so you can work ahead of schedule. quick response to emails.
"Funny lady ! - tells the most entertaining stories in class. Very helpful, plus tons of opportunities for extra credit. But be prepared to WORK; her tests are no stroll in the park.(Is it just just me, or does she look like Suzanne Vega?)"
"I love this woman, she is seriously so much fun. She actually taught at my high school and I loved her so much I had to take her again! She wants her students pass, and will do almost anything to help. She\'s also a goober and is ALWAYS making jokes. TAKE HER CLASS IF YOU CAN, YOU WON\'T REGRET IT! =]"
"I took two classes from Prof. Gamble, and have never had my intelligence insulted or patience tested like that before. He would do well to check his ego at the door - learning is a two-way street!"
"Dr. Gomaa gives homework/quizzes regularly to make sure we are on top of the material learned in class. He gives some real world examples. I like the excel exercises but I wish we did more examples on the board, especially for the math."
Dr. Kiehl is a brilliant professor. He has high expectations but he really knows his material and he does an excellent job of preparing you for graduate level courses. I think his passion for his work radiates through the quality of his teaching. I highly recommend Dr. Kiehl.
she is worst teacher
this is the worst prof in the existence of teaching. He doesnt teach he just reads from the book. On top of that HE DOESNT TEACH THE RIGHT CLASSES. I took CS 370 with him which is software engineering where we study SE. HE TAUGHT 371 WHERE YOU MAKE PROJECTS. HE TAUGHT THE WRONG COURSE. HOW CAN YOU FAIL THAT AS A PROF!!!
"very professional, wants to help students pass, very proficient in responding to questions, definitely would recommend and would like to have this professor for other classes"
This class is easy. Basically just show up. But that is the hassle. Class is annoying and I cannot stand the way he speaks but its a good GPA booster.
"Took this professor a while ago, and it wasn\'t until 2 years later that I realized just how great he was. He is extremely down to earth, and understands how ALL students learn. You absolutely need to put in the work to get the grade. He pushed me in the classroom, as well as outside the classroom. Take him if you can, you won\'t regret it!"
"I thought Brody was a great teacher, he knows the material well. He is also a fair grader. I thought he was pretty funny as well. He answers emails quickly and will most likely give you a time extension on papers if you ask for it. He does assign a lot of reading for the class but it is all relevant."
She is a great math teacher. I am not that good in math and I made over a 100 in her class. she give extra credit and explains problems well. I recomend her to anyone who has problems with algebra.
"Attending his class was very important, he doesn\'t add all the notes to his lectures so you have to fill them in as he goes along. His tests were tough but fair. His final exam was very hard and required a lot of preparation. I attended class regularly and managed an A."
"I took her class online, managed to meet with her often when I needed help. She\'s awesome. She responds to emails quickly and helps you a lot. Exams are paragraph form, multiple choice and true/false. She gives you all the material, easy A."
Great class. Good teacher. Easy A
I found him to be a good teacher for comparative economics. He was always willing to help if you needed it. Just be careful becuase he grades a lot harder than you expect.
"Awesome teacher!!! Very clear and concise. Pay attention, attend class, you\'ll be fine. He went over what to expect on tests etc. He gives all kinds of chances to succeed. Too bad he doesn\'t teach more classes...I would have totally taken them too."
This was a great intro to college writing. She was very helpful and will help as long as you are willing to ask for help.
this teacher does not know how to teach and should not be teaching. is completely unhelpful insults the class and does not explain in detail the assaingments. please do yourself a favor and never take this teacher.
Worst teacher ever. She has one speed and one monotone voice. Gives blank looks when you ask questions. I would NEVER take her again.
"Very nice guy, however not a good professor. I took math 136 but it seemed to me it was more of a class for gambling. Every example used in class had something to do with Atlantic city roulette tables."
"Good course, Literary Approach to Song. He knew his subject matter. It was a take home exam, which was nice. but he marked the papers really really hard. Really intelligent, kind and understanding guy."
"Tara Williams is by far one of the best English professors at OSU! She is very well-organized, has interesting lectures, grades fairly, and helps you leran a lot. She is really big on close reading and I know that the classes I took with her really helped me develop this skill. It is obvious that she enjoys teaching and the material."
angie is great. she is there for all her students and open to everyone\'s opinion. she is gets to know her students very well and is great person to know.
"If you want a professor who is structured and doesn\'t ramble - don\'t take Cerrutti. If you\'re the kid in class who goes on for an hour about a hypo and you like to hear yourself talk, this is the class and exam for you. Also, from a foundational point of view this class was a waste of time since he disagreed with almost every case we read - why the"
Takes A LOT of points off. Better get all homework question PERFECT!!!!!
Pay your bills Frank!!
"The class was pretty tough for me at the start of the semester. If you can\'t handle criticism, don\'t take his class. Following his (or as he says the proper) format is essential to passing as anything less will be a C or worse. Definitely the hardest English class I ever had but I really learned a lot. He\'s funny every now and then as well."
"Mrs. McKenzie is a very good and passionate teacher. She lets students postpone assignments and tests a class or two if needed. Her tests are very hard, but in order to be an decent accountant, you need a good comprehension of the material."
One of my favorite professors. Hilarious guy who is very easy going. Tests and quizzes are simple and you can take them until you pass. You only have to write a few papers that he clearly explains and makes easy to get an A. The rest of grades are to watch movies and write up on current events. Too easy and entertaining guy
"She is a nice teacher that is willing to help when needed. However, she doesn\'t know how to teach. Study guides totally different from tests not to mention what she teaches. Totally unorganized in teaching capabilities and bashes guys in class. Don\'t take if want to suffer pain and agony."
"Lash is a fairly easy grader, except that he tried to grade more harshly at the end of the semester which was unfair. He will pick on you if you don\'t participate in class and assume that you haven\'t read the material. He\'s pretty funny, but I didn\'t like him as a teacher."
"Excellent and Straight forward professor, material is really easy. Make sure you read the textbook alot because he relies alot on concept on exams and quizzes. Class went well but becareful of lab TA he is really harsh at grading!!!"
"Tatiana Alekseevna is a wonderful professor and human. She has very high expectations, but she believes in you so strongly. She will bend over backward for you. She may seem abrasive or forceful, but she knows how the world works, and will try to help you. My only wish is that she didn\'t teach quite so quickly! Material > Time needed to process it."
"Prof Barker is an incredible professor. It is easy to get sidetracked during his lectures because his vocabulary is very high. Pay attention closely to his lectures, read the material and don\'t miss class! he marks your grade 2 percent for absences. If you get lost, he is more than happy to answer your questions( even if they are dumb)"
I had her for theater and improv and also call her my college Mom. She\'s been through alot and is great with advice. She\'s knows her stuff and she\'s still young at heart ...although occasionally pessimistic. But oh so funny and sarcastic. A real top notch lady. HI CHRIS ROBERTS!!!
"I had Michael my sophomore year (I\'m 1 year out of Drew now). He was my favorite professor! He really knew his stuff, very intellegent, easy going...just what a teacher should be. He is the reason why I became an art teacher myself. -SR"
I loved the Steinbeck class! Professor Cotter gives lots of room for creativity. I was absent a few classes and truly felt like I missed out on a lot. Don\'t skip out on Cotter. She enjoys getting to know her students and could be a great mentor.
"Fantastic, passionate, and bizarre. Candela is a tough grader if you can\'t write; however, if you can use basic analytic skills and compose a stylish, tight paper, his Italian Cinema class is a breezy, diverting class. Highly recommended."
Very laid back and funny. Good teacher. Made class interesting and didnt waste time. Had very interesting stories that actually pertained to the topics. Class discussions were fun if you have a fun class. Definitely take him again
"Cappello is awesome. He is a really nice guy who wants you to do well in his class. This doesn\'t mean it\'s really easy, but he is always willing to go above and beyond to help you understand things outside class time. He really cares about all his students and wants them all to do the best they can. Take him and you won\'t regret it!"
"I took this class during his first semester at UMaine. Nice guy. Made the content ""real"" with good examples. The math majors slept or didn\'t attend, but I thought he was Ok. Plus, we spent one class eating Reeses Pieces and drinking apple cider."
She is very prejudice against non Indian students and men. I did okay in her class but I know other people who struggled.
"Really funny and a genuinely nice guy!! His papers are not very hard at all & if you follow directions, you should get an A. We always get out early & class is all group work. Overall, it\'s a helpful and easy class"
"I think my expectations of an online class were too high. I made an A, but I don\'t feel I learned much. There were only 3 discussion boards, and no feedback on anything. I could have emailed but when making a 100 it felt foolish. Probably a great in person teacher, people rave about her. Call me odd but I was disappointed. I love discussion. Easy A"
"Hes clear and precise, very fair, and helpful too. His exams are all open book , and open notes. I would take him again if I had to."
Great professor. Really cares and loves writing. She is the stereotypical passionate english teacher. Very good classes. You get quite a bit of work to do but her deadlines seem pretty soft
"One of the best classes you will take if you like history. Dont have to be a history geek but atleast like it. Mr. Lee is almost an expert in history. You will learn alot. He is demanding with tests and projects. If I passed with a C after 17 years out of school,took in summer,& Im not the brightest or study discipline, U will pass with an A or B."
"Class attendance matters more than quality of work. I have decided not to pursue anymore art classes with JMU because of the liberal grading policies teachers employ by penalizing absences with punitive grades. Saunders had a good curriculum otherwise, and I really enjoyed the assignments. I do feel the class load was a bit heavy."
"Good course, and prof. hambly is very knowledgeable. He was a hard marker, but if you do your work, you\'ll do well."
"Mrs. Dibble is kind, but very unorganized. She answers your question with more questions and puts questions on the test that were not covered in the text nor in her class. Honestly, going to class is pretty much useless because she doesn\'t teach much, however, attendance is required. Try to take someone else if you can."
I\'ve already been through college once and on my 2nd go around. She is by far one of the best Profs I\'ve ever had. She\'s very enthusiastic about the class. Everything is well laid out with notes and practice tests. If you can\'t do well in this class then you didn\'t even try.
He is a great professor! I was moderately interested in the class and after taking him I have considered a job with delinquents. There is a lot of discussion and everything is from the book. He tests the key terms and over people mentioned in the text. Tests every 3 weeks.
"I have seen this make make seniors weep. He is funny, sharp and knows his stuff. Don\'t take him if you don\'t thrive on challenge or can\'t take the heat. But if you really care about the law and really want to learn, there is no better professor."
It was an online poetry class but he\'s really awesome. Specific feedback to help you improve as a writer. Loved it.
He is a great professor. He Loves Psychology you can tell. He tells you exactly what to expect and gives a great outline of the course. He will answer any questions you have. If you come to class and take good notes it helps with the quizzes and he hints to certain questions during lecture that are on the final.
Thank god she is gone. She was a total joke. She has no skills as a prof. Just reads you the text book.
"(Major: Civil Engineering) Bit of an accent, but easy to get over. Has a great way of explaining things. Homework is not required, do as you see necessary. Don\'t be afraid if he makes fun of you, he will always make sure that you understand if you are confused. Do everything as he suggests and the class will go smoothly. **I had AP Calc prior"
"Very helpful and passionate about your learning - going to his office hours is very helpful as he\'ll give you the answers to the homework and help you out with any questions you have. Study the packets (especially definitions!) and redo the examples before exams, ask questions during class, and you should be fine."
The most unnessarily difficult prof at Brock that I\'ve had. The amount of work you put in is not reflected in your final marks. Avoid at all costs!!
"I like Prof. Thayer. I think shes kind of snooty though. But, maybe it\'s just I... said the cat."
"John is a good professor. For this class being a non-WI, there are ""a lot"" of papers that I wasn\'t really expecting. He assigns short readings every other night. Almost all of the quizzes and the midterm are open-book. Pretty chill class."
Nicest lady you can ever meet. Always happy and brings a lot of energy and entertainment to her classroom. Not very clear on assignments and a very hard grader which makes things difficult.
"Professor Kantzler is very helpful, clear on guidelines, she explains all tests and assignments thoroughly. I am NOT a fan of history, I thought this was going to be my worst class, and it ended up being my most laid back class. If you need a history credit she is the one to take! I recommend her to everyone!"
"Great class, strongly recommend"
Dr. Dinca is a very good teacher. He wants his students to get involved by bringing news items and presenting them to the class. It is a class where you can excel and learn a lot if you put forth the effort. I did not have a problem with his dialect at all. I highly recommend Dr. Dinca for AST 1002. He is friendly and helps his students succeed.
"I\'ve had Prof Stedman for a few classes now, he\'s a really good teacher to make a personal connection with. Make it so you aren\'t just another face in the crowd and he will be more than willing to help you through assignments and give his time for clarification. Only issue is he is really bad about getting papers back to students."
"Good teacher. Very helpful when you have a problem. Tests can be difficult but if you do the work, you should be fine. Do the extra credit!!"
great teacher
I disagree with the previous comments. Obviously she has her views about the material- but she is not opposed to new ideas at all. Absolutely fantastic teacher. Lectures with so much enthusiasm and knowledge- and is does not ever feign knowledge... no BS...at all.
"Prof. Jager is an excellent teacher. All her directions are clear and you just follow the examples from the book for the assignments. Also Professor Jager prepares you well for the C.L.U.E. test so don\'t worry. I got an ""A""."
Hardest teacher ever
open book tests. just be friends with people who go to class. final is a xxxxshow bc no one goes to class anymore at the end and no one knows how to do any of it . easy ass a if you have prev. tests bc its the same thing. no notes/slides online but even if you go you might not even be able to read his handwriting.
"Best teacher i have ever had. As long as you show effort, this class in an easy A."
"well, the class is dry top begin with, so it is difficult to be mad at her about that. as a professor, i think she does ok, no walk in the park but if you have to take it, shes not so bad"
"He is senile at times. If the class didn\'t know an assignment was due because he didn\'t mention it, he\'ll get mad at the class and think he told us. I wouldn\'t recommend him, but he isn\'t the worst teacher. Just follow his essay format exactly, and you should be fine."
the subject is difficult but she will explain everything thing and wants to make sure u understand. Always helps her students when they ask questions. Very respectful to her students. Fair in grading . Giving u extra credits for doing your HW wich helps alotttt.
"Impossible to fail! If you don\'t read textbooks, don\'t get it, you buy this book thing with definitions and the cases. The book is just added information and honestly a waste of cash."
"As long as you come to class, take notes, and study, you will do fine. There\'s a few 150-300 word writing assignments but all of the information is online or in your textbook. The tests are easy as long as you study the review sheet."
Bring caffiene. The more you talk in class the better. He\'s uncomfotable and ackward; this definitely sets the mood for the class.
Ms. Vlahakis is an amazing teacher and person. She works her students hard because she loves seeing them succeed. She is by far the best English prof. I have ever had. Just make sure she looks over your papers before you hand them in and you\'ll be fine.
"I tried really hard in that class, ended up bordering between an A and a B by tenths of a %. Ended up with a B, missed it by 6 points. VERY tough grader. I would email her for clarification and she would reply with a condescending remark. 95% of the time she was behind on grades so you really didn\'t know how you were doing in her class. Never take!"
this class is quite boring....
She is great! Makes the class very fun! Class is discussion based and you will have to ready the plays. Be creative.
Professor Sani is a decent teacher. He assigns homework on mymathlab and he is very generous on his tests. He is a little difficult to approach if you have a question and he can be a little intense when he lectures but he is really knowledgeable and will work with your before/after class. He gave me a B and I felt it that was generous.
Good guy. Helped me with my class work and also helped me with my advising and registration issues.
"Horrible, monotone teacher. NEVER TAKE HER! She grades her papers based on her own thoughts and if you don\'t have exactly what she thinks, you\'re screwed. She never gives assignment sheets, so you\'ll never know what you\'re supposed to write about. Attendance is mandatory. She\'s very picky and has her favorites in class. SHE WAS THE WORST TEACHER!"
"What can I say, Ms. Weiser is awesome. She cares about every single student, well organized, and her explanations/examples are easy to understand. She\'s constantly upbeat and positive. Wish more teachers were like her."
The most caring professor I\'ve ever had. Goes out of the way to help his students and tells us all about what other professors hide from us. I needed a last minute rec letter and he goes out of his way to help me out. What a guy! He also went out of the way to get us a copy of the book to the library. Also shows us relevant interesting websites!
"Awesome instructor...as others have said, he makes learning history fun. Took him twice and would definitely do it again!"
"one of the best teachers Ive ever had, very challenging, very engaging, should have tenure."
"Fr. Tom is pretty funny and really knowledgeable; I learned a lot of interesting things about the Bible, but for an intro theo course, he made it way too hard. Just doing the readings isn\'t enough to get an A. Participate & he\'ll like you. Questions on tests super tricky and specific. Final is cumulative. Take him if you want to be challenged."
"This professor was accommodating and nice every step of the way. All he wants is for you to go to class, if you do that, you\'re golden!"
"not a very good teacher...very boring...ALWAYS says the word ""BASICALLY""...in a three hour class, she has said this word around 300 times...yes i was so bored that i counted each time she said ""basically"".............and doesn\'t believe in giving extra credit................"
"This man is the best teacher I have ever taken, his insights into math are amazing. He doesn\'t just teach math with formulas and rules, he actually tells you why they are there and makes you understand that what you\'re doing really isn\'t any magic, it\'s just stuff that requires you to think. Great guy, great professor, best teacher I\'ve ever had."
"The best professor that I have had at MDC! She is an excellent person, she cares about you and your progress in the class. She explains every single essays carefully. I recommend her to anyone! FOr sure! take her the best!"
"Taking a class from Joan, is like a breath of fresh air. Her style of teaching, engages the entire class, she is helpful, and one walks away Knowing the material. There are essay questions, but the assignments are not difficult, if one pays attention."
Take his course if really want to learn. Fair exam if you studied.
Liz is passionate about helping students pursue their creativity. Her class is fun and challenging. She wants everyone to succeed and spends a lot of time working one on one with students.
"Very charismatic, which is helpful because this class occasionally talks about controversial topics. The tests are a breeze if you listened in class, a joke if you even bother to read the text. All multiple choice, and the class overall is enjoyable because of her humor."
"As a 1 hr class, attendance is mandatory because he counts it as a grade. But the rest is easy to follow homework which does relate to the CSE degree plans. If you complete every assignment and show up, it\'s easy to make an A. Assignments are due weekly except one game coding project, but 1 week is usually more than enough time honestly."
She is super nice and always there to help. Ppd is only once a week so attendance is a big part of your grade. The projects arent bad and you dont need to buy the book.
Not too bad
"I love him. His lecture usually makes me laugh at least once a class. I highly suggest him for anyone willing to put in the effort. It\'s not an easy class, but definatey worthwhile."
"John Eliason, while the Director of Writing for the entire university, is probably the least helpful writing professor at PhilaU. He is not helpful at all. His sense of humor is ridiculously horrid and his methods of teaching are purely unorthodox. If you are given Eliason for WRTG-101, drop and switch. You will not like him."
Teachs the material far too quickly.
"Professor Polyashuk is one of the best instructors I\'ve had at NEIU. She\'s very helpful, kind, and passionate about math. She\'s fun, and she helped me pass the class with the grade I needed. Definitely would recommend her."
"Never got the impression he was passionate about his teaching career or students success. Always guess what was going to be on the tests and even when he told you what to study or sent out study guides, most the stuff wasn\'t on the test. Brushed people off when questions asked or left more confused. Material taught not clear. Don\'t take it from him"
"This is a great teacher. He\'s very friendly and smiles lot. If you take his class (recommended!), be prepared to work in groups and to learn the your classmates\' names. He gives alot of opportunites to speak up in class, and follows the syllabus. The class was exciting and interesting."
One of my FAVORITE teachers. Glenda\'s teaching methods are crystal clear. She has the ability to teach all levels of students while keeping everyone engaged and interested. The study packets are a great help...and you will learn in this class! Great teacher - thank you!
"i beg to differ, he is not the greatest man in the conservatory. He is, however, one of the funnier ones, but be prepared to be made to feel stupid"
"Great guy, funny little old man. Pretty easy class, you can BS your way through the short answers on the tests and get partial cred. He makes his lectures interesting and funny, so its pretty easy to pay attention. If you do, you will pass."
The best!!!
"Elza is a great professor, and her lectures are super interesting. You\'ll learn a lot of information from her about individuals and the world that you didn\'t know before. She only gives two papers, and allows you to do extra credit on almost anything. Super fun and inspirational class."
She\'s just awesome!
"Audrey loves to tell (humorous) anecdotes from her extensive marketing career. Most students in the class look like they want to be somewhere else, so you\'ll be favorably noticed if you actively participate during lectures. Exams are tough, but Audrey will tell you what criteria she expects for assignments and she\'s a very reasonable grader."
Very Nice and a fun class
"Do not take this class online, the instructor is unclear and gives off an attitude that she is better than you and you are so beneath her, she gave this speech about excuses and how shes so tough and had heart surgery on fri and came to school and taught on the following mon and so on and so forth. DO NOT TAKE HER!!!"
"Professor Ewen is interesting, engaging and likes to keep his class relevant and contemporary. The three assignments are pretty simple (only drawback is that one\'s a group project). There\'s a midterm and final as well (both open book). Not really a difficult class overall but feel like I\'ve learned quite a bit!"
Needs a reality check that helps her see that an English professor at a community college does not make you better than anyone... Very rude and stuck up
"Whenever I had a problem (whether it be with the material itself or understanding his notes), he was very helpful in getting me to understand. His notes and way he goes through the material can be confusing. You\'re expected to read back through them + the book + Mind Matters on your own to be truly prepared for the weekly quiz. Come to class!"
Fantastic man. Too bad about the smell.
Zapf is awesome! Had her for Psych of Cognitive Processes and she made a topic that can be very confusing and tough to grasp fun and interesting. Loved going to class everyday and talking with her! I look forward to having more classes with her!
"Difficult, but rewarding. I learned a lot in her class. It was nice to be challenged for once."
Take her online class. It was super easy and she\'s a great teacher!
GREAT GUY! Buuuuttt... Not a good teacher. I feel for him because he really tries but he is just too smart and talks waaayyy over our heads.. Its Intro to Chem not Rocket Science. Do not recommend taking him as you will need to teach yourself which is ridiculously hard! Not gonna get an A. Hes a very nice guy though.
"Readings (in and out of textbook) seemed to be focused on the theme of Death, most especially Suicide. Dreadful lack of actually famous authors, most notably Mark Twain. Teacher did not give good reminders on material, almost missed entire Research Paper assignment because it was placed separate on the site."
"Lisa is a friendly approachable prof. She\'s willing to help any student with anything they need. If you study, exams are decently easy. She does everything exactly by the textbook, so as long as you read it you\'ll pass. Group project and marks for attendance/research studies were kind of annoying but it made for easy marks. Overall good experience!"
"extremely easy class, take it"
Half the time she doesn\'t even know what she\'s talking about! She isn\'t very helpful at all because of that fact. I do like that she extends our homework. One thing that really bugs me about her is that she doesn\'t speak in proper english at all and talks in ebonics...
"His lectures may not be the most exciting things in the world, but he explains things fairly well and will treat you as fair as possible. He has always been consistent; he has 6 quizzes, of which you get to drop two and all of the questions come from the homework. He will also give out a midterm and a final, which have different questions."
Dr. McDonald was my favorite professor throughout all of college. She was demanding of quality work and the reason why I was incredibly prepared to enter the working world. She is highly qualified and helpful.
"Goes too much into her personal life. No one really wants to hear about that. Rambles on and on about her crazy college life and how everything is ""sexy"". Class is pointless and mandatory. We learn about useless words we will never use in life. Also, we have to write long pointless papers as well. Don\'t recommend taking honors breakout."
He is very nice and moves well with the class. Sometimes his seems to be not very confident but he knows what he is talking about most of the time. Use his office hours often and you may get lots of help for assignments and test preparation. I learned a lot from his class. He may need to improve his English a little bit more.
Objectively he does not do his due diligence as a professor. No professor only returns ALL graded work on the last day of class and he doesn\'t return all graded work anyway. You have to be independent and study on your own because he is not easy nor is he clear and prepared. He should not teach but should do something he wants. just not teaching.
"Pretty easy to do well, but if you want to learn anything yourself you will probably have to teach it to yourself. However, if you turn in all assignment and do well in quizzes, then you\'ll get the grade"
"she\'s a great teacher and really wants her students to enjoy Greek and think outside the box. work consists of reading Greek passages before class and translating in class, also weekly quizzes, 2 midterms, and 1 final. tests consist of translating 1 or 2 Greek passages and answering some syntax and usage questions"
Doc is one of the best teachers I have ever had and if he had not cared I would not have graduated!!
Excellent prof.
boring as hell....talks all day err\' day....commons blow too..harder than hw and quizzes...no curve either
James Barby is a total sick baller OG.
"This professor helped me understand fractions when no other teacher could. She is clear and concise with her lectures, and helps you whenever you need it. She is understanding and her class is fun to participate in. Be aware that she focuses heavily on mathematic vocabulary. Expect homework almost every night. I recommend this teacher to everyone."
"Dr. Cox is the best professor I have ever had. I am not a math person and not only was she helpful to every question I had but she actually made me love coming to class! I would recommend her to anyone that has to take this class. She created a class that was fun, interactive, and overall a semester that I will never forget :)"
"Inappropriate personal comments, sarcastic not encouraging, rude comments to certain students. Unclear what her focus was supposed to be since the program did a 180 on her role(misleading to those of us attending). Disinterested in my research project, changed it\'s focus 1/2 way thru and never got it back, apparently lost it(Thanks!)"
do not take this teacher
Downside is it\'s only offered online. Teacher is hard to communicate with. It was hard to get any questions answered because she would never respond and if she did it seemed to take forever. I would recommend taking it where you can actually attend in a classroom. You might do a lot better.
"She is insanely tough. If you can handle it, then take the class. It was my hardest honors class. All classes are discussions of readings from hw. She\'s passionate and willing to help, but if you\'re looking for an easy honors class this isn\'t it"
"He\'s an airhead and laughs at every thing he says for no reason. He\'s unorganized, but gives you most of the answers before the exam. There are some questions that he doesn\'t cover in class that are on the tests. He\'s a crazy guy"
Terrible...simply terrible.
"Greg does not know what he is talking about half the time. His exams are usually trivia, basically how much info can you memorize. The only time you need the textbook is when you study for his exams. He gives clicker questions for 1/10 of a point for each question. Half the class doesn\'t show up and the other half is sleeping or on their phones."
Incredibly interesting helpful and knowledgeable
Awesome & entertaining
"Well, this professor is good but needs to improve the way he grades because he gives you a lot of homework per class but don\'t give you any points or credit for that. Exams consist in 50 questions each one. The extra credit is only 3 points, but it is really really hard"
Dr. Hunt talks alot off the subject of Chemistry. He does know alot about chemistry and is willing to help you out by giving bonus points. This semester we were able to earn up to a 150 bonus points. Even though we had a lot of bonus points we still had to study!
"She is a nice teacher, but she is ALL OVER the PLACE! she told us on the first day that she expects you to know the textbook front to back, because she doesnt follow it what-so-ever. she is very helpful with reviewing material before test days! you have to come to class, because she makes you accountable for it, and doesnt repeat it for exams"
"Professor Douglas is brilliant. He is witty, smart, and interesting. You\'ll never have a boring class, and if you just pay attention you will pass with an easy A. 11/10, would take again."
idk if amy is counted as a prof. but shes really cool to teach us in the audio annex. knows her stuff and has did it before as a student. get her lab if you can because she takes time to sit with you. she wont do work for you but she gave lots of guides and practice so we dont need to ask. easily my favorite class.
he is great... he dropped the f*bomb
I was terrified to take public speaking but professor cook creates a relaxed environment so it isn\'t so bad! He\'s hilarious also. He gives extra credit and he is accessible outside of class. He made a class I was dreading into a class I really enjoyed. I would recommend him for a basic speech class he\'s super easy!
Her online EWRT1A was actually very interesting and relatively easy. 3 essays and weekly discussion posts. No in-class essay. I learned a lot by reading the books. Highly recommended.
"I have never been a great writer and dr. Poteet\'s class really helped with that, teaching us useful skills we could actually use. As long as you put in effort you will get a good grade."
very articulate knows his material great sense of humor
"Nice at times. Gives very good notes. Tests cover way too much material, but if you study, you should be fine."
He\'s a decent instructor. Assignments are good. He shows genuine interest in what students are doing but I wish he would offer some sort of help on technique.
"If you are looking to be challenged and you really want to LEARN Chemistry, this professor is perfect for you. He really knows his stuff and while he is not easy by any means, he is always available and willing to help you. I would take this professor again in a heartbeat."
This class is very lecture heavy but extremely easy if you have a solid background in biology and are able to think critically. The discussion sections really help clarify some concepts and I love my UTA for it. I didn\'t show up for half of the lectures and still did really well.
"She is a great teacher. She expects a lot from you, but is there every step of the way and wants you to succeed. She was my favorite teacher all semester. Listens to any idea or question you may have. Allows for lots of independent work, so it is on you if you want to succeed. Work hard and she will notice."
"It\'s very obvious that he loves teaching this course. He\'s really a nice guy, and has all sorts of stories to tell about the material. Do not underestimate the exam, though."
"I\'ve taken prof. Satsutani for the last year or so. While early on he might come off as unprofessional. He\'s really a great guy once you get to know. He is a very strict grader, has a quiz at the end of every class. And participation is basically required everyday in the form of speaking practice. I won\'t lie when I say you need thick skin for him"
"DON\'T TAKE ANY OF HER CLASSES! This teacher is the worst teacher I have had at HVCC. I know computers very well, and she found a way to make basic stuff very difficult. She does not offer you help if you need it, and will humiliate you if you ask for help. Avoid her at all costs!"
Berta is super easy. shes a nice person too. although the subject shes teachers wont the most interesting.. she usually gives good grades too students that seem like they are trying
"He is a weirdo, star trek geeek who wishes he was Indiana Jones when he is more like John Wayne Gacey"
"Waguspeck is a good professor overall. She answers student\'s questions really well and seems like she actually cares about her students. Although her eyes seem to be close 80% of the time, I enjoy her class."
"Yes, vey pompous, arragant, thinks that HIS way is THE way to analyse post-tonal theory. We only read his work-in-progress texbook with quite a few errors, and his dissertation, which is typical Eastman know-it-all rhetoric. Too bad, he is a good guy!"
"One of the toughest teachers I\'ve ever taken. His exams are hard and really test you on if you know the material. Michael is a good teacher, though kind of boring to pay attention to. He never makes eye contact when you talk to him and is always doing something weird with his lips, but he gets nicer if you stick around til the end of the quarter!"
"I took this class as an elective because I thought it sounded interesting even though I had already had many soc classes while many students were brand new to the subject. Even though it was a 101 class, I learned a lot from it...even after taking 300 and 400 level soc classes on different topics. This lady is amazing and really funny!"
Very nice professor. go to class and pay attention. take good notes and you will get an A in the class. you don\'t need the book. everything he talks about in class is on the test. all clicker questions are on the test. easiest class i have ever taken.
Dr. Michaelson is such a sweet lady. She really cares about her subject as well as her students. She is very interesting and never boring. She does teach from PPT. It was very helpful for me.
"Such a nice guy, soooooo easy to get an A. Just read the slides. I don\'t think he\'s going to teach the class much longer, though."
"This is an extremely difficult course; don\'t go into this class expecting an A, because chances are you won\'t get it. The professor is intelligent, and his discussions are usually very thought provoking. He will improve your writing skills, but at the expense of your GPA. I hated the class when I first, but as time passed I began to appreciate it."
He is OK. Too much hype before I took this class. Would rather take a class from someone who works in the industry.
"I was really disappointed in this class, I thought it would be really interesting, but her lectures never had any focus at all. She\'s very nice though and the guest lectures are interesting sometimes. Not a very good teacher, at least for this class."
"Mean man. He thinks he is some kind of genious but he teaches at CASC. Class is not hard, I just want to comment on the person. Get over yourself, Holton. You are not a good teacher"
"judging by these ratings she was a better teacher about 6 years ago. Now she has clearly prioritized her other responsibilities with the school and is constantly telling you how she needs to be at one event or another (loves to brag about her required travel). Instruction suffers greatly. Assignments are unclear, errors in almost every posting."
"Very helpful and good at explaining things. Sometimes test questions are very challenging, and sometimes not. His voice resembles Barney the Purple Dinasour."
"This professor is awful. He will decide not to come to class very last minute. (not that its always a bad thing) He doesn\'t teach anything. He goes off on rants and no one even knows what he\'s talking about. Since he doesn\'t teach, he gives out tests and no one even does well..which is clearly his fault. I didn\'t like his class AT ALL."
He was a good teacher - I understood what he was trying to teach.
"Good teacher, knows what he\'s talking about. a little spacey but he was new. he\'ll be excellent with more experience. didn\'t make us turn in homework (which math dept may change) but you should do it anyway. most importantly: he knows what he\'s talking about and he\'s fair"
Very good teacher. Makes sure everyone understands material RIGHT before taking a quiz. Gives real helpful practice test. Real big on partial credit. Best Math teacher i have had at UC
"This class is just easy, although really unclear about what you are accomplishing because of Trey\'s constant ventures off topic, but he sincerely cares about young entrepreneurs and setting them up to succeed. I would say you have to make an effort to not get an A in this class."
"Professor Pescatore is an amazing teacher. He seems to genuinely care about what he does. He has helped me draw things that I never thought Id be able to draw and he makes what seems impossible, very easy to achieve. Love him!"
The best prof EVER... She ROCKS!!!
"This woman is the most unprofessional instructor I have ever had! She spoke of political topics that do not have any place in the classroom, did not actually teach a topic but rather ""discussed"" hot topics and American culture, and belittled & discouraged students."
GREAT TEACHER ... do estra credit and print notes. test are out of the notes and FYI to the stars on the notes = on the test.
"Mrs. Thomas was excellent. She was very thorough in her teaching and very helpful. If you don\'t do the assigned reading, your grades will reflect because you have to understand the material, not just be familiar with it. Mrs. Thomas gives a lot of great examples in class by showing video clips, and many other things. I would recommend her class."
He was so helpful and loves math.....he\'s very funny and his class was one i really enjoyed
She was great. Wish she taught at UIS more often.
"Prof Ali is a very good professor. He literally makes everything clear and easy for you to understand the material for the class. His sense of humor keeps you engaged throughout the whole semester. Pay attention, attend class participate and you\'ll pass. He\'s awesome!!!"
She doesn\'t teach. Reads from the slides. Doesn\'t let students ask questions during the class. Poor teaching techniques.
What a wonderful teacher! She is such an inspiration! I will never forget her!
"So far my favorite teacher here. He is very passionate about his subject and extremely fun to listen to. He\'s funny, smart, and very involved in the community. You know he leans left; he makes it very clear. However, I feel as though the discussions in class were pretty balanced. I think he\'s pretty respectful of differing opinions."
"Julie is a wonderful instructor. Nice, friendly, and funny. Easy class. Class mostly involve lectures. I have a strong interest in fashion so this was one of my favorite class. Show up, do your work, and you\'ll pass."
He was really helpful during office hours
"He\'s a little nutty, but usually explains things very well. He\'s willing to help if you see him in his office. HW is optional and he gives out the questions for the quizzes. Good teacher."
"He flies through the material, but makes sure people understand it. Very thorough and pretty enthusiastic."
He is the worst teacher I have ever had. Do not take his course; it will be the biggest mistake of your college career. He is rude and unprofessional. Do not waste your time on such a horrible teacher and human being.
"Always willing to help, if you go in for office hours. Review sessions are very helpful. Nice enough woman. Lectures are boring, though."
"A very fun, professional teacher. She is very excited and enthusiastic about the topics she teaches."
"I would highly recommend NOT taking a class with professor Holly Andres. She is rude, snobby, and pretentious."
"It was an online class, can\'t really say anything about her"
"I love this professor! She is very easy to understand with her directions, is very friendly, and very energetic. She grades fairly and is totally into her subject. I never missed a class because I really enjoyed learning from her. She is awesome!"
"very easy teacher. always in a good mood and is willing to help out. class can sometimes be boring, but you get to watch a lot of videos. take the class w/ a friend and it\'s not too bad. gives lots of notes that are sometimes confusing, but easy tests and quizes."
"he is a good teacher. he explains concepts, exercices.however, you should read your notebook before coming to class, do your homeworks, practice the exercices doing in class. If you are lazy, dont take his class. still, I could assume he is a fair professor."
Really nice and helpful
"true that she did go vey fast, but also wanted her students to get A\'s. kind of tied down as how to teach the class as all ACC 101 is the same for each class (final, workload etc.) helped review for final plus 1 easy and interesting project. took accounting in high school so it was easy for me. she isnt the worst teacher"
"Oh man, Dr. Botting is recommended for all you classes. Although his grading is tough you will pass with at least a B if you know whats going on. He is funny. Great teacher!"
Generally unenjoyable person to be taught by. Felt like I was back in high school.
"shes such a sweetheart...always gives you study guides for the test...only 3 projects which are fun and easy! you have opportunites for 3 extra credits bt the time is limited, umm will give hw once in a while (not big small hw) she always wears adorable hats and has a big smile on her face everyday! u can tell she loves doing what she does.."
Not such a bad teacher if you ask me considering that my major is going to be Applied Psychology. But since it is 9:00 a.m. and I\'m half-asleep he is pretty boring. Dont take him in the morning because you will be bored out of your mind.
"Dr. Chien is absolutely adorable and a wonderful professor. She makes the class fun and interesting, provides her own set of notes and really makes sure students understand. She makes every effort possible for students to pass and succeed. She\'s also very patient and sweet."
cutest old woman ever she has amazing insight on the industry. No homework just a final midterm and group project. Gave out review sheets and went over it if you studied that you got an A on the exams. She told us only to look at the definitions in the textbook thats it. lectures are interesting but long GREAT TEACHER
Has an attitude problem at some points. also you work soooo hard in her class that at the end she doesn\'t give you the grade you deserve. she is also ****.
He\'s a smart knowledgeable funny professor. He\'s also isn\'t afraid of the debate in his class and he likes to mix it up. He\'s also laid back. He expects class participation and to have done the reading. Had a good time. I learned a lot I and questioned a lot of things.
Dosen\'t understand english well enough to answer questions. Away for half his classes. Always getting the math wrong. (at least once every class). Do yourself a favour and switch classes right away.
The most monotoned professor you\'ll ever meet. He also is the hardest grader ever. Watch those significant figures! He\'s not afraid to take off like 20 points for errors in sig figs.
"Very nice, very helpful when needed. Easy A."
"Awful teacher, be prepared to teach yourself from youtube. His powerpoints, tests, and worksheets are all premade from the textbook. Very lazy teacher, if asked a question on how to do a problem, he very seldom can get the correct answer. I do NOT recommend him at all, spend your money on a useful professor. This guy shouldn\'t even be teaching."
Way too hard! Treats the class like it is grad school which is great if you make it fair. The class is way too hard when everyone is taking it as a pre req for grad school! You will relearn all of it again so do yourself a favor and take someone easier!
Good
VERY EASY BUT ALOT OF STUDYING FOR QUIZES AND TEST. HE TELLS GOOD JOKES TOO.
honestly just go to class and there is no reason why you can\'t get atleast a B. Study pretty well for the tests though they can be a bit tricky
I think that she is a great teacher you do have to study alot but i never took spanish before and i am doing extremly well and almost top of her class and half the people in there have had a few years of spanish under thier belt. if you want to learn take her class.
Mr. Gaines is a great professor! He is so willing to help in all fields and he is very polite. His class is hard though but he will go to the ends of the earth to see you succeed. Study study study!
"Ferris is a good teacher and conveys information to the students in a fairly clear manner. The only problem is that the class is like 80% busy work that has nothing to do with the material. The midterm was fine but for the final, he teaches everything at MACH 5 in the last couple weeks and everyone gets blindsided. 1 sheet of notes for tests."
"She is sucjh a nice lady. True she is a spaz, but it is entertaining. If you have questions she is more than happy to answer them fully and she is very flexible with office hours. Highly recommend taking her."
"This class isn\'t hard if you just review the power points. All of the information for tests are on there but people still fail this class all the time. Her lectures can be boring because she drags on with 5 minute sentences and talks to people like everyone is planning to be a nurse. The class isn\'t too bad, but it\'s not fun."
Best teacher I\'ve had at ATM. Never a boring class
"Research and design is a tough class, but dr. olson is very clear on what is expected. he takes time to explain every detail. i really liked that he is very organized and approachable prof."
"Why am I not surprised about his ratings!!! He has not changed a bit. He always played favorites and it has not changed. He should have been fired a log time ago. Boy, does he stinks!!!! I cannnot wait till he retires!!!!!"
"I hate to admit, but despite her obviously extensive knowledge of the german language, she has poor teaching skills, and is very disorganized. She is, however, always available to help when you need it, and is an extremely easy marker! A 6-credit course with an A+ is a great boost to your GPA! :)"
"I love Professor Martin, she is very helpful and very clear. The class requires the electronic book and expect homework at least twice a week. This class is only a 100 class but I would defiantly take more classes with her."
Wayne is the best talker in the advertising program. He keeps class interesting. I wish he would have taught my technical classes... maybe i would have gone business.
"Hardest Class I\'ve taken, yet one of my favorite classes. Ive never studied so hard in my life, but I know the material better for that reason. This a class only for hard workers. Dr. Ko is truly an amazing professor who loves his students and really wants them to succeed. I would defiantly recommend him for this class."
Worst teacher at De Anza. His poor english interferes with his lectures and he did not follow the testing schedule written on his course syllabus. 100% of his class is read from the books powerpoint and he does not respond to emails. You may as well just read your c++ book at home.
"Since this is a prerequisite for many professional schools, expect to do the work. Too many students complain about the rigor of the class, but honestly, the class will make you a better healthcare provider in the end. For all it\'s worth, those complaining can at least have a chance to change their academic path if they can\'t handle micro."
"She\'s such a caring and kind professor within the CYC program. Gives great feedback and she gives students the chance to catch up on the online discussion posts for participation marks. I\'ll be honest, I never read the textbook unless I had to cite something. Her classes are very easy and straightforward."
"DR. ANDERSON IS AWESOME! HE HAS A GREAT SENSE OF HUMOR AND EXPLAINS THINGS VERY THOROUGHLY. HIS SLIDES ARE VERY EASY TO READ AND FOLLOW, HIS TESTS ARE T/F AND A COUPLE SHORT ANSWER QUESTIONS."
"She is incredibly quiet to the point that you physically can\'t make out most of what she says in class. Class moves too slow because of her and she doesn\'t take it to other interests for students. However, she\'s very accepting of late work."
"guys if you love to study and live at the same time. do not choose her class otherwise you will have to study non-stop and can not live your life. other teachers teach too, she can not teach. just talking talkin talkin and thats all."
Best teacher I have this semester! VERY energetic. Makes the material interesting and fun. Is very helpful and easy to communicate with. She\'s just awesome!
Good Professor..make sure you just do what you are assigned and you will be good
"A very easy class, she tells you exactly what to study. HOWEVER, you might want to slit your wrists during her class because she doesn\'t shut up (she talks more about her than she does about the class material). She also tries to engage the class in discussions, but usually no one is interested."
Judy is awesome. I took her for a once a week 3 hour class. She is very helpfull. When you need her even when she was at home she was avalible for class.
"Ummm... hes okay but i wouldn\'t take him for a class, Glad i only had him once a week for lab. Hes too strict and attendance is also necessary. Everything is online on McGraw Hill Connect."
"Great guy, one of the nicest and most helpful profs in science. Chemistry isnt easy and hardly fun, but somehow this guy makes it easier to understand and interesting to learn. Lab reports suck...:-P"
"Although I believe that he has the potential to be a great professor, he basically rants the entire time. We\'ve all come to the conclusion that he just enjoys himself talk. However, if you ask for help, he is more that willing to assist."
Take this class please!! She is awesome <3
"AWESOME! I love her as a teacher and a friend~ She is someone you can talk to about anything and she will be there to listen. She is not ""EASY"" by any means, but she will work with you until you get it. By the time you leave her class, you know y"
"Professor Hall is an awesome teacher. His assignments have you actually apply what you learn in class to real life. This class is interesting as it is, but Professor Hall just made it more enjoyable. His tests are challenging, and they will actually ""test"" you. I would recommend this class and professor to anyone who enjoys communication."
"Extremely helpful, funny, and just a nice guy. He\'s always willing to clarify things if you ask and is good at answering questions about what he\'s taught."
"Dr. Craft has incredibly engaging lectures. There are two tests and a final (cumulative) with short answer/listing questions on the exams (usually he warns you what will be asked) & multiple choice questions (very specific), studying is necessary to do well. There are pop quizzes, online quizzes, online lab homework and group lab work in class."
"she wasnt the best teacher i have had. she wasnt organized and focused too much on being ""cool"" and ""young"" or identifying with the students and focused too little on teaching english."
"the readings are good but the classes are a bit boring. there are only five books and one paper for each, so the work load isn\'t too bad. it\'s a fairly easy class, but the discussions seem pointless."
"What a terrible teacher. She decides to bribe the class with a bell curve of 85% rather than do her job. All this to get hired full time, perhaps there is a reason you\xe2\x80\x99re a visiting professor. Here is an idea actually teach your students and perhaps stop depending on your notes so much."
"She can be very irritating. By that I mean sending out last min emails, waiting until 2 days before the midterm/final to send out a study guide, and not posting the ""correct"" grade on beachboard. She reads almost directly from her PP slides, and can be boring. 3 midterms, final and an easy paper. Just show it to her a week before it\'s due. Also, for the whole semester, her email didn\'t work. And she\'d say that she posted stuff on BB but we couldn\'t see it. She is however very nice & approachable"
See the blue frowny faces everywhere? That\'s what your face will look like at the end of each class.
"She is very hard to follow, beacuse she works to fast. she asumes that you already know all of this material. you are basically going to be teaching yourself. Make sure to use the book!"
"Dr. Smith\'s lectures kind of go all over the place, but he covers all the important things. He is a chill guy, very easy to approach, and helpful. The tests are challenging, but mimic reality-academics is not just about recalling facts, but integrating them into new scenarios."
class is very easy if you pay attention! Use the book to look up the words on the study guide and you will pass every test! attendance helps your grade but not mandatory!
"Youngblood is super funny and he tells us wonderful stories. He\'s great with feedback and he teaches you to be less afraid to do public speaking throughout the course!! Sometimes he gives popquizzes if there are only a few students in class - so make sure you go every time!!! Also, He is SUPER chill"
"Bridges really cares about his students. He is heavy on lectures so attendance matters for your own good. Just the right amount of hws, thorough and clear lectures, so it is up to you to practice for extra time to get a decent grade. He is always there to help you with math struggles and is very helpful too. I would definitely take his class again!"
Dawn was fantastic! I had her while she was covering Persuasion while Dr. Sawyer was on maternity leave. She did a great job at explaining the difficult theories. She is super passionate during the class which would keep us interested. She also was always very open and willing to help before or after class. She is one of the best teachers at WC
"I don\'t understand why this course\'s test has so many questions about definitions. This course is math, right? Homework is mathematical question on the book. However, the test only has few questions about math. Others are questions asking you definitions. Also, she thought she\'s humor but she\'s totally not. I chose wrong code below."
"So attentive to students, very approachable, and tells his students what to expect in terms of exams (his practice exams are great). You will have to STUDY, but it is not AT ALL unreasonable."
"Do NOT take this class with this professor. Prof has ambiguous grading criteria, and is generally apathetic. Lecture slides are almost 8-10 years old and are poorly organized. One has a modification date of 952005. Class feels like it\'s being prepared and delivered by a high school student doing a class project with insufficient knowledge."
"As long as you come to class, suck up, don\'t be tardy, and do her assignments as they say, you\'ll be fine. I enjoyed her class and would definately take her again."
Great Teacher and fun class!
"3 exams count for 90% of your grade. He curves and counts attendance as 10% of your grade. Highly unrecommended. Take another teacher, or as other raters have said, you\'re ""doomed."""
"attendance crucial-once a wk class-lot of work for 1 credit, but i learned a lot about researching, which can always come in handy. hw is used towards a final research paper which is easy. the oral presentations are tedious to sit through. he\'s corny, and he pretends the class is a studio audience, but take him if u need that 1 credit."
Nothing to say anything good about this man
"This teacher is wonderful. She is extremely intelligent, funny, and she absolutely cares about her students and is always willing to help. This class is not easy, so study hard. I have learned so much from her. I wish she taught more science classes, I\'d take her for all my pre-requisites!"
he only cares about his own opinions now yours
Super easy! Take her! Only 3 essays and a portfolio! No midterm or final! You will not regret this class
"He\'s a very passionate teacher! He is one of those teachers that actually try to help people learn something. His whole class was planned out in a class schedule given at the beginning of the semester, and he does well in sticking to it, yet while making adjustments when needed (neat and orderly yet understanding). Very knowledgeable and fun!"
"Professor O\'Connor was a wonderful professor. He was always willing to help on assignments for his class, and his lectures were great. I wish I had the opportunity to take another course with him but he has been retired since 2013 I believe. He told me he believes with my dedication and attitude I will go far with my major in Sociology."
"Angela Bowie is the greatest professor I have ever had. She is an amazing person, leader, and teacher. I can honestly say Professor Bowie saved my life. I do not know where I would be if it wasn\'t for her. Please do your self a favor and take this class, Im considering taking this class a 2nd time even though I already got an A in it."
Why the complaints? I didn\'t think Reep was mean. Controversal maybe. I dont really like English but I still got an A in the class so he can\'t be that bad!!
"Awesome teacher...has a sense of humor, he hates the Yankees and talks about it..huge plus!! :-) pretty cool guy and class goes by quick, h/w is very simple."
Dr. Moreno is a great professor! I really enjoyed her class. This is not a class in which you can just show up and expect to pass. She wants you to learn the material. What professor would do that? Her lectures help greatly with this. If you need any help she\'s more than willing to help you. She\'s a professor that really knows what she\'s teaching!
"she is a really good professor and seems to know her stuff. One thing about this course however is that the DEPARTMEMT tells her what she can and can\'t do, and how to go about grading. She has no control over this so it is not her fault if some assignments are challenging. She\'s VERY nice and understanding and will happily answer any questions."
You Will Work For Your Grade HANDS DOWN!!!! BUT... Professor Broadwell is One of the Most Intelligent Professors I Have Ran Into At GSU by Far! The Class is 100% Interesting and You Will Gain A Lot from the Class.. If You Dont Like To Read Then SHE ISNT FOR U.. However if You A REAL COLLEGE STUDENT OR SOMEONE WHO WANTS TO GO TO GRAD SCHOOL.TAKE HER
Definitely knows his stuff. A really nice prof
"Awesome professor. She\'s willing to help, and tries her best to keep class interesting. Explains clearly and uses class time to make sure all students practice. She\'s understanding and gives some leeway for mistakes, but try to keep up with all the little things that are required. Then its a breeze!"
"Jukes is my favorite instructor at YC. Had him for several classes now, they are an oasis from the typical community college environment. If you love discussing great works of literature, critical analysis, and interesting lectures, Jukes is your man!"
"GRADES THE PAPER SUPER HARD. she seems timid and like she would be an easy grader, but don\'t be fooled. also, GO TO CLASS. I missed 2 more than I was allowed to and I got a terrible participation grade, even though I felt like I participated a lot."
"Professor Baird is a good teacher, he is also an actual therapist so he has experience with abnormal psychology. He\'s very good about sharing what it\'s like to be a therapist, so if that\'s what you want to be, then take him. His tests use the Textbook author\'s testbanks, not his own, so sometimes the questions aren\'t covered in lecture. READ!!!"
"Math isn\'t one of those subjects where you can talk your way out of getting a problem wrong. People on here complaining he\'s a tough grader just don\'t know how to actually solve the problems. He teaches very straight forward, answers questions, and reviews homework. He wants you to understand how to do the problems rather than memorize them."
"Prof Schiller is a fantastic professor. I would take him for all of my engineering courses if I could. Exams are pretty straightforward from the homework and lectures, and he\'s very approachable."
"This class was a mistake. I learn well in online settings, yet the professor was unclear, posted the wrong syllabus, gave us incorrect dates, and was demeaning when I emailed with questions. The textbook is online only and a joke. It cites wikipedia and has no reference or table of contents. Big waste of time. Will be replacing the grade."
very good teacher; excellent class if you keep up with the course assignments.
Dr. Flaherty might have been hotter before he cut his hair. It\'s debatable. But he\'s still pretty foxy for an almost-middle-aged administrator.
"Really hard class. Spends very little time teaching you actual basic techniques, already expects you to know what you are doing, but is really supportive and helpful with helping you improve. Don\'t show up late or miss class whatever you do."
"Great professor! Sometimes the material is hard, but as long as you do it, it\'s not hard to make a good grade in the class. He is very fair and I highly recommend him!"
he is the best professor ever he is clear funny and if u study you will do well definitely wud recommend his classes
"The bottom line is, if you don\'t like literature, don\'t take a lit class. All of the negative reviews you see on this page are clearly from lazy people who don\'t want to commit. The reason we pay so much for this education is to learn something right? Don\'t avoid Lewis because of the workload. She is an amazing professor."
"She is an ok professor, a little weird but nice."
"Amazing teacher!!! He\'ll print out packets and go over them during lecture and then give you a test review for you to do before the test. He\'ll go over the test review with you in class before the test if you have questions which was the best. As long as you study the test reviews and homework, you should have no problem getting an A/B."
Professor Jones is extremely helpful and he seems genuinely excited about teaching which is a nice change from most of my professors. I highly recommend taking his class.
"Get to Lab early to copy the notes on the board, all of your labs will rely on your understanding those notes. He is a little strict on how you run your experiments, but it is good practice for the future and the ""real-world"". Good professor."
She\'s a good teacher and is very available for help and office hours. Class is frequently let out early and sometimes cancelled all together. She\'s makes math more interesting than otherwise possible and has very good review sessions for tests.
"I have never been so mad at a professor. His projects are so deprived of creativity (it shows in his own stuff too), he cannot teach, he\'s is so rude and insults you if you don\'t do things his way or make a slight error. He may have been in the industry for a long time, but that doesn\'t mean he should teach. Save yourselves and avoid him!"
"I enjoyed the subject matter and the discussions, the lectures are hard to stay aawake for though"
Never opened the book once and still got an A. Her Indian accent is hard to understand so you really have to listen. Her office hours are inconvenient but are helpful if you come prepared with questions.
"Okay this class can be a bit ZZZzzZZzz but it\'s first year Psych. what can you expect? Just read the book, and learn the key terms, and you\'ll do fine in his course. Overall a good prof who knows his stuff."
"I absolutely loved this class. This is some difficult material to learn and he does a great job at making it as interesting as he can. He described things so it\'s easy to remember. He is absolutely hilarious at times. You definitely have to study your ass off to make a good grade, but I honesty think he is one of the best teachers I have ever had."
Really cool guy. Super laid back and the class is really easy and fun. Definitely take him if you can
"She\'s an amazingly intelligent and sweet professor who conveys all the information crystal clear. There is a lot of information to memorize, but she gives a review sheet and everything is from the notes."
Great teacher! He was very visual and in depth. If you cant pass his class dont bother attempting 185. His class set the foundation for the rest of the sciences. If i went to him for explanation he always helped. Even gave me some material for 185.
CONTENT IS KING!
"Lectures are all based on being in class. Nothing posted to blackboard. 1 research paper to write on your choice. Tests are hard, and lots to read. Not clear on what will be on tests. Need to really ask for help and show her you are trying, otherwise, there will be no help."
He was the rudest professor I have ever had. I got an A in the class from working very hard but it was definitely not with his help. He acted mad almost that I was doing so well in the class. Should not be teaching.
"This guy is the man. Very funny, very easy."
"Horrible Teacher, Told me to quit the class when I went to her for help."
He is a funny guy but not the best teacher. He tends to go through his powerpoints way faster than anyone who is trying to copy them can understand. He knows his material just seems to have a hard time helping his students understand it.
"Unorganized,condescending, Hard, tricky and annoying. Test are extremely hard and longer compared to other chem teachers. He thinks he funny but he\'s not and thinks you already have a Phd in chem. DO NOT TAKE HIM!"
"Nauman is easily one of the worst professors I have had. His text book is beyond terrible, and his lectures are useless. I felt like the class was a waste of time."
Soooo boring. Sitting through class was torture. He is unorganized. Nice man but should re think teaching. The subjecxt matter of Org. Psy is pointless. DONT NOT TAKE THIS COURSE!
"Good class, Murch was willing to help his students as much as possible. Exams were fair."
"Bob Patrick was a very interesting prof. Always excited and very welcoming with any concerns, questions or extra help. Midterm hard, but paper graded very easy if you put in the effort. Final was average. Good prof"
NEVER AGAIN!
hes a great guy the tests are not ment to trick you. and go do the extra credit it helps alot
"Discussions are mandatory, and she does random attendance quiz checks on REEF all the time to make sure people are coming to class. Lots of online homework, and she doesn\'t remind you about it so you have to be on top of it. Her curve is pretty huge, an 85% is an A, and her tests are pretty fair."
My experience with this professor was awful. The writing was a lot and nothing was graded within a timely manner and there was no comments on papers. The grading criteria is not clear at all since she always changes what she wants at the last minute. She doesn\'t grade everything so paper is always wasted. Group projects happen a lot.
"I had a extremely hard time taking online Stat. There was not a lot of help or class participation on the teachers part. Although my emails was answered quickly, and she was very nice. All the test was on the Hawkes Learning System. I would recommend taking on campus instead of online. I was happy to receive a passing grade!"
"Probably the best teacher that I ever had. Pam put in 10x as much work for her students than the other nursing professors. By the end of the semester I truly felt like she was someone that I could call on and trust as I go through this nursing program. She does have that little intimidating factor goin on, but you get over it...real quick."
"very easy class and easy to understand. easy A if you do all your work and show up. tests and essays are a lot of common sense, nothing mind racking. very enthusiastic teacher and she loves class participation. class is a lot of discussion, so it can get a little drawn out and boring at some points, but overall very interesting and easy."
She is very organized. You know what you have to do. Maybe many assignments but they are easy to do. Good textbooks.
She is such an amazing lecturer! She teaches in stories and uses facts as details which makes lectures fun and entertaining. Best lecturer I have had so far at Cal. She is also easy to talk to during office hours and offers a lot of support to her students.
"Most boing class ever, fighting to stay awake. He\'s very into his stuff, and expects you to be also...hard grader."
"Great teacher doesn\'t mind helping you. Very understandable and works with you, just talk to her. She\'s a real sweetheart."
"Dr. Morgan is a BRILLIANT man. His British accent is also super appealing. However, a few down falls are that there is A TON OF READING. Hundres and hundreds of pages. Can do well as long as you read. Lecture is pointless and not mandatory, just a big, open discussion."
VERY VERY STRONG ACCENT. Makes it difficult to understand him. Does not talk about anything relative to the tests. They are 100 questions each and you are timed so you better read the book 40 times. I never missed a class and talked to him after class a bunch of times. He said he would help me out and i still ended up with a C.
The class was really straight forward. Her tests were fair and she gave out a study guide for each. Follow the syllabus and you\'ll be fine. Read the book and you will end up with a good grade.
"This guy cracks me up. He tells the most unique little stories, and he always gives the greatest extreme examples. The tests are difficult, all multiple choice, but he\'s a great teacher. Just read the book and do your extra credit experiments..."
"Very difficult class at times. Because its only once a week, it is a lot of work. Some parts are easy (journals, essays) but she calls numbers at random so make sure and read! Nice lady overall."
Ms. Wiggins is great teacher. I highly recommend her class.
"The best Math 1050 teacher I had (out of 3). He wanted his students to do well and would spend extra time to ensure that if they wanted to, they would do well in the class."
"I had her for nutrition and she was great! The subject material can be kinda tricky, but if you stick to the power point, come to class (not mandatory but you get points taken off if you dont), and prepare before class you\'ll be fine. I saw below that someone said she was strict, but shes just very clear, and if you dont follow instructions (that"
"Here class is really easy, and it is pretty much common sense. She also says that attendance is mandatory, but she basically stops taking roll after the first couple of weeks."
"Great class. I\'ve never studied art before, but I learned a ton by attending lectures. Gave me new perspectives on a variety of topics. I recommend her. The exams are tough, but class work is pretty easy. Definitely a good teacher to take!!!!"
i can clearly define how this class will turn out if Dobbins is teaching.....you will hate it and if you still take this class you deserve to suffer
She comes off all tough and serious at first but she is the Grandma I wish I had. Super caring and wants you to succeed. There are NO group projects. 3 tests with a super easy outline. 3 assignments where you read a chapter in the textbook and apply it to marketing. 1 paper-8 pg. If you go to class you will get an A. Her lectures can be a bit dry.
I lover cooper and her southern accents and love for cats. I was sad to not have her for art history this semester. I definitely recommend her 100%
Taking her now. Finally a teacher who provides helpful feedback!
"Dr. Casey\'s lectures were interesting, but he was frustratingly unclear about the expectations for the essay and oral presentations. Seemed obscure and finicky in marking. When approached outside of class, he was rude, indifferent, and defensive if pressed."
"An okay and a bit boring class, but I would still recommend it for your last theology. Daily readings and reading responses (about a paragraph), an image analysis, and a final project. So basically an assignment for each and every class (seriously). No midterm or final though. It\'s basically an art history class."
"This guy lectures and then sends you off to figure out the excessive weekly homework solo. Once you get home, you\'re completely lost. Thanks for nothing, pal."
"If your looking for an awesome professor, this is your man!"
"Took online course this winter, not bad at all! Everything is on canvas- quizzes, short essays based on readings/videos, and a final. Workload is manageable, all \'do at your own pace\' which is great-I finished early! She also responds quickly to texts if you have questions. Great professor and a great way to get 3 credits over winter break."
"Really easy class, as long as you get on Jack\'s good side. If you can impress him with an article by the end of the semester, then you will get a guaranteed A."
Doc is the greatest professor anyone will ever have at Wagner. You can talk to him about ANYTHING and he is just an awesome person.
"I never took a class from him or have even seen him, yet I filled out this survey!"
"I\'ve had Manickam for several math classes-actually looked for him as a prof. and worked my schedule around his class times. Hard to understand sometimes due to accent, but makes math fun. If you need math, look for his classes. Do homework, study for quizzes, which test comes from quizzes, and you\'ll do fine. You\'ll learn more than you think."
ur so cute!!
"This professor is horrible, mumbles, isn\'t on time. His tests are out of blue, they are nothing of what was discussed or chapters to be read - they catch you off guard."
"If you try prolly get a CD or higher, Nazi Grader"
Pretty nice Professor but gives a lot of homework.
"This is such a great class!!! I learned so much and my family loved hearing about the new things I learned. Everything was straight forward, would take this class again. Pay attention and you will pass!"
"This class is hard! Dr. Eligon is a REAL professor who is actually going to teach you physics. If that isn\'t what you are looking for, take someone else\'s course. The exams can be a little bit too tricky, IMO. I had to work really, really hard for the A I just barely got.. but I understand physics! And isn\'t that the point?"
"She is a high school math teacher during the day and a professor in the evening. Although she must be very busy, she is very punctual and professional. She is compassionate about what she teaches and offers a lot of office hours and review. 2 tests throughout the semester and then a final. I loved her and would take the class again."
"Seriously, don\'t take her. Her class is long, annoying, and boring. She is also never their to help you. Really did not like her as a teacher at all"
"I agree with everyone here. He does nothing and you get no feedback whatever. I really wanted to learn something. Too bad I didn\'t. He is the laziest teacher ever, he never goes the full class and never gave us grades, so my final grade was a surprise."
"Chris is the sweetest, most down to earth person ever! I am currently taking CFS122 with her right now and she makes the class and material fun and interesting. Her class is usual level of difficulty, it is definitely easy to get an A if you keep up. We dont have midterms or finals in her class! Yay!"
I took his class online and loved it. There were very easy lectures he posted and asked students to complete simple discussion boards each week. He provided excellent review material for exams too! I would recommend this class 100%! (you also don\'t need the book)
Weekly assignments and a final training proposal due the final week of class. Grades were posted within a day or two. Great professor. Highly suggested!
"There are 3 essays and the portfolio, one midterm, and no final. She grades very easy and gives lots of feedback. The textbook is considered mandatory, but I was able to get away with not buying it. Make friends with someone that has the book and you\'ll be fine."
"Pretty boring, although the class only consists of two exams and a paper. Pretty easy."
Class was not too bad. 3 exams and she goes over the exam not every question but she does do a review. Presentation at the end of the class but its really easy. She is nice. Not a hard class at all.
"Took him for CH101, and he\'s the best professor I\'ve ever had. Hilarious, smart, willing to do what he can to make sure every single one of his students gets as good a grade as possible; really just a great professor. He\'s like Mr. Rogers meets Bill Nye meets your cool uncle."
Is a horrible teacher! I asked her for help and all she did was explain what i was supposed to do all over again she NEVER helped me with the work at all! She has poor english grammar and her powerpoints are full of mistakes which most of her students have to correct for her! I have never hated a class so much in my life. No use of book.
wonderful teacher! shes amazing and gives out so much extra credit! im taking her again for 152 because shes sensible and fun!
A hard class but his tests are taken all from his lectures. Stay on top of your work and papers because you don\'t want to be writing a 5 pg. research paper the night before. Otherwise a great teacher.
Exceptional teacher and professor. Kind and considerate when interacting with students. Tries his best to bring you to level so you can answer your own questions. Do not be swayed by handful students who do not come regularly to classes and criticize him for being consistent and fair.
"not a very nice teacher, ok sometimes outside class"
"I absolutely loved ben. You learn through PRACTICE in his class. EVERY DAY you draw from a model. You get to chose which drawings are your ""best"" for grades, you learn something new every day while actually improving your life drawing skills. Very go with the flow, and makes cheesy jokes (which I loved). Favorite class ever."
Great teacher. Always has time and quick to offer words of encouragement. Definitely a man who goes above and beyond what\'s expected of him
"One of the best professors I\'ve had at Cal. The material is very eye opening and he is very interesting and inspirational. If you have the chance, take a class with him! you won\'t regret it!"
"Wasn\'t my fav but not the worst. Pretty easy dude. Try and do the readings and you need to participate in class. Three relatively short papers, and midterm and final that he gives the answers to before it. Didn\'t pay too much attention and was absent a whole lot and still pulled off a B+"
grading scale is completely out of whack. NOBODY in the class got higher than a C on ANYTHING. feedback is confusing and she doesn\'t explain assignments very well. I do not recommend this professor.
"A lot of reading,but if you read I think it would be impossible to not get an A. Offers small extra credit opportunities and tests require you to write a lot but if you read the books then you will do just fine. Discussions were sometimes boring or pointless the class could be held twice a week instead of three times."
"While Dr. May is a well-respected professor, I did not find this class to be a ""gen-ed"" course. If you are looking to take a gen-ed, DO NOT take CHE 111, but rather 101. This is based solely on the textbook material and that is very clear from the get go. No study guides for test, very hard to study for and expected to memorize EVERYTHING."
her grades come out of nowhere. boring and unhelpful.
A waste of your time and money. It\'s a shame that he can\'t be bothered to actually teach most nights.
He\'s an awesome professor. I took this class to fulfill a GenEd and ended up learning a lot. He\'s very expressive and has an uncensored mouth which makes his AM classes ALIVE!
"Professor Lane is awesome and he\'s super funny. The only thing is that he would either get off topic or he would be all over the place with his lecture. You can\'t really get proper notes, which is difficult when it comes to his ""writing exercises"", which are really tests. You have to read the textbook thoroughly and teach yourself."
Does anyone else find this guy extremely weird? He talks about reality and what is real... how about he come back to reality.
"Terrible teacher. Highly unorganized and incoherant, flaky marker and overtly hard and unrealistic on assignments. Think twice before enrolling"
I enjoyed being in Mrs. Macri\'s class. She is always willing to help but may be considered harded because she has high grading standards.
"Very smart and interesting. He motivates you by making class differnt than most college courses. Plus, he\'s tall and handsome!"
"He has a russian accent (duh). Don\'t need to go to the lecture unless you absolutely want to. Pretty straightfoward quiz/test, not so hard. Study for the final because ppl don\'t and you\'ll get good grade."
"This class is a joke! Students would literally be snoring in class. He lectures in a mumbly tone that you can neither hear or understand him. Doesn\'t assign due dates and very unorganized. Most students use his class to do homework for other classes. 3 (7-10 page papers). Very kind man, but if you want to learn, avoid!!"
"COMPSCI100 is an easy class- made a 99 on the final exam. Lots of homework and assignments, but they aren\'t tough- time consuming though."
"The overall class is pretty easy but Catherine is so fake she will tell you that your doing amazing in class when your getting a B, she never returns graded material before the end of semester. Gives you 50+ images to memorize 1 week before an exam. Overall she needs t get organized, but the class is interesting at times"
She is wonderful. She makes her lectures interesting. I had her for 1302 and 2327. She is one of the greatest teachers I\'ve ever had.
"Ansari was great! Test material comes straight from the handouts on each chapter. He is very funny. Although he can be difficult to understand at times, he does his best to reword things if people do not understand him. Taught material very well and covered it thoroughly - especially if you are taking Physiology."
"Boring. Tests were absurdly hard. All we did was crunch numbers, no concepts. I even like math and I couldn\'t stand it. Online homework is a pain. The labs were completely useless. Worst class I\'ve ever taken."
"Great professor. The class is intriguing, and the discussion well-rounded. He has a sense of humor and an ""appeal"" that works well with his students."
"One of the best at FGCU - very intelligent, funny, interesting. I\'ve learned so much from his classes over the that I wish I could continue taking them after I graduate. His classes are tough, but there is no doubt that you will leave knowing a great deal about the subject. He also has a great personality and sense of humor."
"Okay. She wasn\'t the best teacher I\'ll ever have and she\'s not the worst. Read the chapters before you take the test because a lot of the info comes from there, only an overview comes from the lecture notes."
"She is a very nice teacher. She gives lots of easy extra credit is you dont do so well on the tests. Grades easy, give a study guide for each test. If you do the study guide you will do good on the tests."
"She is a very good teacher happy and cares about hers student\xe2\x80\x99s progress. She dedicated time out of class to help me understand some grammatical mistakes. Whenever she sees me, she is very friendly and she offers her help if I need something."
I ended up paying for tutors to help me in the class. I did not feel the professor was approachable and he did not allow the students to utilize the free tutoring center on campus. I needed help and had to pay to receive help from private tutors. This is wrong!
"I took Eickemeyer for PHYS 208A,B, and C, and got over 100% in each class. Key to success: Know every example from the notes (including random examples you wouldnt think he\'d test you on), and every problem he assigns from the book. If you can do them all you will be fine. Quizzes are exact copies of the book problems he assigns. Lots Extra credit!"
"Dr. Commisso is an excellent choice for psychology class. Her exams are moderate, and she explains what she is lecturing very well. There are extra credit opportunities that are pretty easy. Make sure to study for her exams, and READ THE BOOK. Her class is a worthwhile learning experience which, for me, made psychology much more interesting."
"One of the worst professors Ive had to date. Relies 100% on TopHat, which is a seriously flawed program. Never knew my grade the entire semester and if you ask he wont tell you. Didnt respond to emails. A different professor writes his tests so Pappas lectures usually dont correlate with the test material. Overall, hes really just an ass."
Great teacher! I enjoy his passion for the art of film as well as his desire to teach!
"Excellent in Presenting material. He is certianly a preacher, and is very adament about teaching the subject of the life of Christ. Best sermon I have ever heard was in his classroom."
"poorly prepared material, unhelpful after lecture"
I took him for Medical Sociology. It was an easy class because he graded easy and b/c he made things easy to understand. I recommend him to anyone interested in sociology.
"Mme. Rusnak is friendly and makes us all feel comfortable in class. She has trouble teaching literature. This course is more about history than literature. She likes to make us memorize facts and definitions but doesn\'t help us develop skills. She is very oldfashioned and uses no technology at all. A nice lady, a boring history class."
Dr. Engerer is very mean. He enjoys making people feel stupid. If you do a problem on the test right and he doesn\'t like the method you used he will count points off. Do not be deceived about the grading scale it still is horrible the average is around a 45 on his exams because he enjoys his students misery.
He is tough but fair. He really helped me when I was struggling. Gruff but has a great heart.
"This guy is an absolute joke!!! He\'s one of the most rude people I have ever met. I asked him if he was going to be in his office in an email, and he emailed me back saying he said it in class. What a jerk!!! His lectures are stupid and he interjects his personal opinion in everything! Don\'t take this class!!! Worst teacher ever!!!"
She is SUCH a good teacher i highly recommend her. she really cares about her students and does whatever she can to help. TAKE HER!
"If you take a class with Kapoor, you will be GOLDEN! Medical Mircobiology is hard itself, but if you study, go to lecture, and ask questions, his exams are EASY SQUEEZY LEMON PLEASEY. Study and get an A, study and get an A, study and get an A, did I mention study and get an A? By the end of the course with Kapoor you will be a HAPPY PAPPY person!"
"Ms. Ossa is the best teacher! She is very easygoing, and is so much fun. She has a great personality. You will never be bored in her class."
"Best prof in my 4 yrs @ BSU! :) SO understanding, down-to-earth, funny, & welcomes any questions. Always willing to explain & reword things. Incorporates written activities and discussions so student actually learns. Learned more in this 5 week class than most other classes when profs simply lecture. Made the class fun! -- highly recommended!"
"Excellent Professor....very challenging class. Multiple exams, takehomes, and weekly homework sets."
"I went to 2 of his classes (not including test days) and I didn\'t learn anything from it because as hard as I tried, I couldn\'t keep awake. His tests ARE tricky, so make sure you read the book. Don\'t bother coming to class because his lecture notes are online and also because it\'s a waste of your time."
It\'s an easy A class. Attend all convocations. The textbook was 10% of the whole grade. Be punctual. The class is fun seldom boring. Dr. Wheatland is friendly and approachable. There\'s a lot of opportunities to attain extra credits.
"Prof Gaskins is a great teacher. She tells you exactly what will be on the tests so if you come to class, and take good notes, you will pass. However, DO NOT expect grades back in a timely manner. She is very sweet though."
"She is an amazing teacher! Really passionate about philosophy, which makes the class easy to understand. She always makes sure you understand the topic before moving onto the next part in the lecture. Always available for office hours. She is one of the best professors at St. John\'s! The quizzes are easy, just study the last lecture notes."
RICK is the coolest professor we have at CSULB hands down. he gives solid and honest feedback on work and keeps the crits interesting for most of the part. take him over any other prof for any illustration class.
"She\'s a great professor! Id you just do the hw and study, you will pass! Its difficult because it\'s a whole new language but overall a great class!"
"Good public speaker, short classes. Uses blogs and relies on online material. Should have been an online class. A LOT of material, but outlines it all. Routine quizzes are open book and 3 research papers not so bad. Only 1 test = final. I would have had the A+ if I didn\'t slack at the end. Would definitely recommend him and take him again."
"Class consists of readings then discussion of the reading. Grade is midterm, final, and participation (attendance). Midterm and final are fictional scenarios of bad leadership/virtues that you respond to citing some of the readings. I would recommend taking her, grading is pretty easy and she is good at getting the class involved."
He is a teacher who I have never seen in my life. This class is not difficul but I got C with it. I am very angry with this result because I wanted to take it to make my CPA higher but I were not what I thought. it is very terrible for whobody take the class with him.
Great professor! He cares about his students and is very helpful.
Very good professor. Fully online class. Straight foward with all assignments offered.Weekly quizez. Must get book very helpful tool. Do all work on time and will get an A.Definitely recommended !!!!
Pretty easy class. Attendance was mandatory. Def knows what he\'s talking about(wrote the book.)Warning: Made the class participate in dancing and singing.
"Highly recommend you go to class as you learn everything from the textbook and with examples from the prof, she explains things well, and will call upon students for answers fairly. Fair marker."
\xc3\x80 premi\xc3\xa8re vue la mati\xc3\xa8re semble tr\xc3\xa8s interessante mais les difficultes viennent du fait que le prof nous prend pour des fiscalistes. Elle part souvent de nulle part pour nous parler des cas tr\xc3\xa8s pointus et specifiques et elle saute souvent du coq \xc3\xa0 l\'\xc3\xa2ne. Le probl\xc3\xa8me c\'est que pour elle c\'est simpl
Nothing else to say but she\'s the best I would take her if she taught all courses at LCC
Make sure to do the readings thorougly!
"Taylor is good professor, he knows so much! he wasn\'t very enthusiast though, which is understandable when there are 300+ gpa-oriented premeds who are not at all interested in the material anyway. i learned to love organic chemistry after this class! exams are fair, you\'ve got to put a lot of effort."
"Very good teacher. She knows how to teach, and is willing to give extra help. I would take her again."
Legend
"Bailey knows his stuff, I\'ll give him that. I was suprised as to how old most of the readings were, though. He also occassionally contradicts himself and his lectures are dull. Interesting readings, though."
Mary should not teach Math!!! I think I know more than she does.
very helpfull. easy A. Her english is bad but you are there to learn Spanish! Take her classes. Will let you make up exams
"After first class I didn\'t know how I was going to survive this semester, but he is actually a really good teacher. He know\'s a lot about the subject and gives good examples. He is good at explaining but sometimes becomes a little to repetitive."
"Friendly, honest person and willing to help. Seems like she\'s just over students trying for an easy A so DO. THE. READINGS. Your answers don\'t need to be \'right,\' you only need to show you put some effort into it for a good grade."
"Overall, he was a helpful professor and made the classes interesting. However, there were homework and test questions on material that we never went over in class. You definitely need to already have a background in the material and calculus to do well in this class."
"Nice professor, if you want to get an Esau pass, take his course. If you want to learn something, take other section."
"I just finished her online class. She does not give clear directions, especially on the required Cultural Paper. She does not answer emails in a timely manner."
"I enjoyed her class. I found it challenging but not impossible. She\'s really nice, even though she says that she doesn\'t give A\'s."
"Prof. Gallegos is great at teaching mathematics. He\'s very heavy on teaching process instead of technique, which is perfect for me as a mathematics major. I\'ve had instructors before that teach how to do something, whereas Prof. Gallegos teaches *why* to do something. Great teacher."
"Good teacher - a lot of reading though. But she loves the work she does, and as long as you stay on track, you\'re guaranteed at least a C, but more than likely a B. Attendance isn\'t mandatory but highly recommended to get the grade."
Pretty boring. Fairly easy. Some tests are hard.
This class is ridiculous - she doesn\'t care about her students grades. She gets defensive when giving suggestions for teaching. It\'s labs and tests. Tests are impossible. Average grade is a 55 in class. Avoid this class!
"She expects you to come to class ready to write a well-written paper. She will make it obvious if you won\'t pass the class, going on saying ""go to the tutoring lab"" or to drop the class. If you\'re a good writer, this class will be a breeze for you. If you\'re not good at self-guiding through papers, good luck."
"She\'s a nice professor. The class isnt hard at all, but hella work. 10pg as Finals in which you have the whole semester to work on. As long as you do your HW, u can just copy & paste your HW as your finals. She\'s very understanding and doesn\'t intend to fail anyone. I turned in my finals 4days late + low quality and I still pass the class with C."
She is an amazing teacher. if you respect her in the class setting you will have no problem getting through her class.
"this was an absolutely wretched class. was covered a new concept everyday, from projector slides, meanwhile he explained the concept WHILE you\'re scurrying to copy down the slide. hopefully this website does not remove my honest review so that this website may live up to its purpose and warn people who actually care to learn this subject."
A very supportive and helpful professor. Brooks gave great feedback and was always there to help. One of the best profs I have had...awesome
she is a great person!! makes the class interesting.. is very understanding and nice to her students.. the class isnt the easiest but she gives study guides and wants to help her students.. take her class!
I loved his class. Dr. Auchter is very helpfull and he treats his student with respect. I\'ve learn a lot in his class. I don\'t know way other students are haters! May be they did really poor in his class. Well too bad!!!
"bernales is the man to take trig with, before he gets into formulas and equations, he thoroughly defines concepts and clarifies applications. i wish he taught calc."
"Such a fun professor! Really interacted with students and was absolutely hilarious. Gave a lot of good real life examples to help us learn the material. Was slightly tough on grading papers, but helped us learn in a fun way."
"Harjinder is a great professor. I was terrified of taking management account. However, Harjinder made the class a lot easier and I was very comfortable with this course. He is really funny and witty and really cares about his students. DO all the online assignments and get easy 20% + 10% of the budgeting assignment. NO quizzes in class."
"Jamie knows what she\'s talking about, and her personality in class helps the 3hrs more interesting. But don\'t expect to get too much help outside of class. Her schedule is too busy to ask for much of her time. If you have concrete questions she can answer them, but don\'t be on a quest for guidance because you\'ll be disappointed."
Tracy is such a nice person. She is very helpful and teaches a potentially boring subject wonderfully. Her class is so fun and her labs are easy!!! Her class is an easy A (not to mention a fun one!).
"She is a clear cut teacher, just do your work and no problems"
"A fantastic teacher, Cal Townsend is extremely engaging. This class focuses on political philosophy, so be prepared to study the Ancients. The TA marks the weekly reading responses brutally, so don\'t be too discouraged; it happens to the best of us. All in all, take his course. He\'s loud, opinionated, and funny. You\'ll learn a lot."
hey
She\'s an awesome proffesor she helps you with everything and is very laid back. I would reccomend you taking her!!!!!!
he is very nice prof...very humirous he also helps you about your health and make sure you do more than 14 articles for better grade
"Alot of note taking! But tests are fairly easy, take notes and study the terms, you\'ll gurrantee yourself at least a B on the tests. Homework is easy as well, just your own thoughts."
Really good class! I had a great time! I took this class completely for fun (didn\'t even fulfill distribution requirements) and really loved it! I would definitely take another class with her. She enjoys teaching and has a fun time in lectures-her comical comments and anecdotes really make the class. Take it :)
One of the worst teachers I have ever had!!!
amazing teacher..super helpful
"She is a slow and calm person. She\'s pretty out of it but is a great artist. This should be the easiest A I ever get. She tells you from day one ""I am an artist nota teacher, everyone will get an A."" Although dealing with her may get frustrating, she is sweet. I would DEFINITELY recommend her!"
"90% of the class knew what was going on, the other 10% want a grade handed to them."
Hard grader if English is not your best I suggest don\'t pick him
"She asked me why I was late to class and to be funny I said ""I guess there\'s no accounting for my tardiness"" she stared at me for several minutes and then gave me a F. Don\'t ever use that joke."
Frau Bush is the most amazing professor at UD. She is so helpful and wants you to succeed. She allows re-writes for everything and won\'t let you fail her class. I would 10/10 100% recommend.
Not a very nice or helpful teacher.
Would not recommend.
King is very knowledgeable about stats and I thought was very clear and precise. I found it better to not do the homework he assigns from the book and just do his online practice problems and redo the class examples. The book is horrible and very confusing. If you study this class is not that hard. (don\'t skip classes!)
What?
"she is the worst teacher, taking that class with her as my professor was one of the worst mistakes of my college career."
Enthusiastic about the subject and willing to help with questions about class and slightly flexible about turn-in dates. No complaints.
"Professor is so funny and one of the most sarcastic teachers I have ever met. Make sure you get the textbook ASAP. Make sure you have your participation points at the end of each class. and make sure you do the online tests she assigns. she also does pop quizzes, sometimes back to back. BEWARE."
"he was funny, and actually kept me awake in an 8am accounting class."
"she is the best teacher i ever had she understands students and whats more she is ready to assista at nay given time. Those who say she is the worst I tink its them with a problem see uncooperative students will always have something to say even if they are given that 1+1=2 they will still want to prove that that is wrong, This is my advise try her"
"Keeps you interested in the course. He is very clear and give helpful analogies to what is being taught. test are tricky but they are not out to get you. However, you do have to put in the effort to pass."
Very intuitive. He doesn\'t shove a bunch of formulas down your throat. I had stat 21 with him too. His midterms and finals are hard. Barely ever uses the book. I should\'ve done what the previous poster did - studied like a madman for 15 days instead of 5. Ended up with an A-. One of the better professors in berkeley.
"Pete\'s the bomb. Just had the final. IT WAS SO EASY. I\'m surprised that people are complaining. If you studied from the practice material he provided us with, YOU WERE GUCCI. Plus, he\'s hilarious. Halloween lecture was bomb. Literally ;)"
The test was absolutely nothing like the class.
"For an introduction to Web design class, it is pretty challenging. Not only is it tough for non-web majors to grasp right off the bat, tim does not always help the cause. My head spins in every class, he knows a lot about the field, but when asked about assignments, he does not clarify anything."
"Very nice prof., pretty easy, all take home quizzes, definitely take."
"Professor Brown can be arrogant and he does love to hear himself talk, but the man is absolutely brilliant. He knows what he\'s talking about and it is clear that he is passionate about the subject. His class is a must for any English major - the class discussions are great and very thought provoking. I hope to take classes with him again."
"There are not enough characters to properly describe how much I regret taking the class and having been her student. Even if it happens to be a mandatory class, do not take her, wait till next semester and save yourself from the figurative and in some cases literal tears that come from taking her class. I wish I had been warned."
His slides were completely useless and his lectures would put the class into a trance-like state.
He is hard to understand. He does want you to actually learn about history. It is hard to pay attention. He does give you a way to pull your grade up though which is helpful.
hardest teacher! terrible.
"She is a great teacher. I had her for Fall 10 for Spa-101. She is very funny, kind, polite, loving. She is more like a family member. I loved her. Her tests r super easy too. Take her and i don\'t see why u wont get and ""A."""
I had Ms. Delaney when I was at Hickey back in the day. She is an accomplished woman and a good instructor. She was the coolest teacher there. Her classes were the most helpful when it came to practical skills that you use in real life. She also gave me some personal advice that I still remember and use to this day.
only grades you on test and attendance and participation.
She is a horrible professor. Really nice and easy to talk to but she is not a very good professor. We got through 1/4 of the things that we where supposed to. Each class (if she was there) was a wast of time!!!!
"Awesome professor who will help you outside of class. Her exams on based on her power points so, you won\'t need your textbook. She speaks very fast so be prepared to write as quickly as you can. Attendance isn\'t mandatory however, she will give extra points sporadically so show up and her exams are lecture/power point based."
"Very nice teacher and concerned about her students.I liked her teaching method, easy to undrstand.She is smart and knows how to teached."
"Defreese is a fine teacher. He will lecture all class which yes can be boring, but the content is simple and easy to understand. You WILL have to read the book, but if you do a chapter a week you\'ll be fine. This class has a heavy emphasis on group work. While it can suck if you have an unmotivated group, it can also make things a ton easier."
"Shes a great prof, knows her stuff but her exams are hard. She warns u at the beginning of class that you must attend every lecture. Read prior to class, and study weeks ahead of midterms/lab exams/final exam. Take her seriously, students tend to underestimate her before the 1st midterm"
he is a really great proffesor i enjoy his class i would reccomend him to anyone who either needs it for an elective or is just intrested in theater!if you need any help or dont understand something he is really easy going and will take the time to make sure you understand it.
"Todd is great. Great class, great presence, and very flexible. As long as you do the work, meet the due dates, and so and so forth, you\'re on your way..."
Hard class. Alot of reading. Quizes every week. Not enough time getting to know each section before quize. VERY HARD CLASS. LOTS OF READING
"Fairly manageable class with an easy workload. There were weekly modules you had to complete with usually three online lectures, discussion posts, and weekly quizzes. Participation really matters in the discussion posts and the one group project debate. No tests or finals, just weekly open note quizzes. The prof took a lot of time to grade though"
"Her lectures can be difficult to follow, but she provides outlines and she wrote the textbook, both of which are very helpful. Don\'t take the class if you\'re not interested in culture, because you\'ll learn a lot about it! The class isn\'t hard, but to do well you really need to read everything and work hard on the paper."
I thought she was great! Very sweet personality and knows the language well. Good communicator and good teacher.
Hes an amazing teacher i now like math alittle more he makes it easy to pick up.
VERY HELPFUL
Tonya Price is one the funniest women i know. She makes class enjoyable but expects you to work hard outside the classroom. Lets you out early to work on papers. Recommend taking her spring semester cause she cancels class if its to cold. Lots of papers but always their for her students. tough grader but not to bad. Highly recommend!!!!
"I dont know why all the reviews are saying the same , i took her class and it is hard to pass it. her tests are so hard as well as the study guides."
She is a fantastic professor. I would recommend her to everyone.
I took him in 2008 also. He\'s a really good professor! I liked his class a lot!
"Class was ok but quite bland overall, he is probably very efficient in the medical/corporate sales world but does not have a lot to offer in real world sales.. I\'ve been successfully selling products and services since I was very young and his methods and input come off as both dated and industry specific as far as technique. Nice guy but limited."
"Great Professor! I\'m not even interested in geology, and he made it interesting. He provides copies of all his power point slides so you know exactly what is going to be on all of his tests... no suprises. Overall, outstanding!"
"Great Witt Sem class--weird music, lots of listening, lots of work but not too difficult. Lots of class policies but I followed them and got an A. I want to go to India!"
"Great Professor, he held the classes interest and made assignments meaningful. Overall good course and good professor."
"Probably 30-40% get D\'s and F\'s on the tests. She curves at the end. Very nicer person, but you have to do a lot on your own. This is the weed out course for Accounting. Do you homework and get help if you need it. Plan to work hard."
"Very easy class, nice guy knows his stuff. Got me interested in Geol, shows that it is possible to learn a lot without having a really hard class."
Dude the man died... he inspired me to pursue english as a major instead of psychology. he was so cute and had such cool things to say about the bible and relationships relating to english.
"Dr. Lezzam is very intelligent, helpful, professional, and due to the content of his course BORING!! If you love the Economics take your nest class with him, you won\'t be disappointed!"
"Worst teacher ever, has no right to teach. He should work in a Lab and not have any contact with people. He knows chemistry, however he does not have any teaching skills. Do not take his class unless you have some understanding of chemistry."
She is strict but If you work hard you will do good.
"Amazing professor, you will change as a writer."
"You\'ll either love her or hate her. She\'s got questions, no answers."
"Although none of us had any idea what was going on throughout the entire semester, I still somehow ended up with an A+. Had to buy a lot of books, but you only read parts of them. Didn\'t learn much, and wasn\'t too interested in reading books about the Hindu culture."
"I ended up not having to take the class, but for the time I was in Professor Weaver\'s Calc 2 class he was great. He\'s thoughtful of his students and takes care to make sure everyone is understanding the material as he lectures and goes through examples. All around cool guy."
"Pointless class, pointless instructor, just pointless. Just. Pointless."
I like Miss Black she made you take a lot of notes but on the overall she taught the class like an professor should. Most of all you had to study inorder to pass
Awesome professor I would highly recommend her class. She was very helpful and understanding.
I\'m not good with math but hey she made it easy. All other math teachers I\'ve had at Cerritos not so helpful as she is.
"lost student homework, if you dont pick up ur he will throw it everyday. boring class hes a boring person too. exam is difficult and need to spend a lot of time on text also hes kinda sticrt on everything no late homework no make up quizes test homework stuff i am so regert took his biology class. he ruined everything in my life.not takin any bio"
this is the stupiest class every she does not help you at all she will just sit there and quietly mock you while everyone else is listening do not take her you wont be happy
"She cancels class a lot... which is good but at the same time the syllabus changes about every week. I would have liked for it to have been a bit more consistent, but overall she was ok."
Professor Kawamoto answers student questions really specifically and spends a lot of time going over details in lectures. You can tell he wants students to do well. Does get a little verbose at times.
Professor Abbott is a fantastic professor. She is very sweet and caring and very intelligent.
"Super chill prof and is very approachable, but tests are made so your racing against the clock and shortened against the time limit, and exam was made unlike any of the tests taken."
"Her lectures were clear, and the class activities were awesome (I.e. free writing; mindfulness teachings). She did give consistent reading assignments and writing but nothing difficult at all. 10/10"
Her teaching strategy is horrible bc she assumes that since the students who have taken high levels of spanish prior can answer the questions that everyone should be able to as well. She grades harshly and it doesn\'t really matter if you study a lot because you will get marked off for little mistakes even if you show that you understand the concept
"In the beginning of class first thing he says is you will have to work for your grade, but his lectures are what\'s going to be on the exam. Do the homework take notes do not miss class and you will be good. I took him for financial and managerial"
"Dr. Harlow (Richardson) is AMAZING!! She is extremely experienced and educated in what she is teaching. Her stories bring to life the material that you are learning. If you have the chance to take her, do it!"
There wasn\'t day that went by that he told me that he hated my guts. Once you get past the rough exterior and his cussing at least he grades honestly. If you have to take him do your work and keep your distance.
Never choose her classes
Spanish class can be intimidating when you do not know the language well and if you do not participate she will not like that. She is a very strict grader and if you miss class she will not help you make up work. The online work is very tedious and is not helpful with the lectures she gives. On top of online work there are a lot of written work.
very good lecturer but exams are tough!
I tried so hard in this class and did not pass. Toughest grader ever. He is very nice but do not take Eng 101 with him
"Has great teaching methods. Challenging and fast paced, but thorough. Aims to teach you the language, not just grammar and words. You miss a class, you\'ll miss a lot, but he was available after class if you needed help. Was great, will definitely be taking him for Spanish 2."
"Understands the meaning of Oration. Gives passionate, interesting lectures. Easily reached after class for questions/help."
"Seriously, what drug is this woman on? I\'m still not sure how she is qualified to teach Contemporary Native Issues-- she\'s a anthropologist!"
"Easy class. Had it once a week at night. Go, hand in your page long reaction paper and do a wordsearch, you\'re guarenteed (sp) a B. Beyond Boring but an easy grade as long as you go. Also, she can\'t hear well at all so you can talk and laugh in class and she is oblivious."
"One of the most hilarious profs at Seneca. If you mess up, she\'ll make some sarcastic joke that would be incredibly rude to you, but insanely funny to others. Need a solid study habit but you\'ll learn a lot. I mean isn\'t that why we go to school? lmao"
"Prof Lisa is a very kind woman, she will do anything to help you. The lab hours at this is to go to gym so hurry and pick this class if you need to lose some of that calories :) Not to mention that her lectures are actually interesting."
"Professor Kimball\'s lectures are very straightforward and easy to understand. If you\'ve ever taken any sort of US History class before, this class is a breeze as long as you do the readings."
"good professor to sleep to. if you want an easy A, take him. if you want to stay awake in school, don\'t take him."
"man, he doesn\'t even know anyone\'s name. i\'ve taken the guy for 3 years and he\'s still drawing a blank. you just get your token ""B"" and leave."
"Despite being assignment-heavy, Warnock\'s class is easy if you do the work. Attend class, and the tests are really simply so long as you study the Lesson Objectives. Warnock\'s a smart man; he can ramble and get side-tracked, but he knows his business and you can really learn from him."
mod and sim. online course. do the homework. straightforward. go an extra mile with the projects. not good with email response or phone calls. very clear online lectures.
"AWESOME CLASS! I\'m not good w/ computers but I had fun with this class. I reccomend him very highly. He\'s a nice guy who just wants you to enjoy and learn at the same time. Making the website is fun, just pick something you like."
"Really helpful professor. Whenever you have questions, she is always there. Respond to email very quickly. Clear on lectures and homework assignments are extremely helpful."
Weak.
"you probably don\'t show up to class thats why you fail...EASY EASY EASY class, just go to class and memorize notes automatic A. I\'m a MMB and Math major and I needed a GPA booster and this class will do it. its annoying when he keeps repeating stuff but JUST GO TO CLASS!"
"He is a very good professor. you cant understand him easily. But if you try to understand you can learn lot of good things from him. When he is explaining anything, he will give you a perfect reason for that explanation. He is the best professor, Tennessee Tech univ had..."
"Doctor Vandenberg is one of the nicest professors you will meet at Siena, does his job extremely well ,very understanding and not a tough grader; if you want to get an A and give it a shot, you will. honestly great guy and excellent professor."
"Nice, speaks with an accent from Spain, grades kinda hard."
Human Growth - She was an overall nice teacher. There are a lot of notes and she does not let you bring a laptop. She pulls random things from the book and does not give a study guide for tests. Make sure you study and read the chapters!
"She is always late. Gives a lot of busy work, but if you show up to class you will do well."
Began the arduous process of unraveling the imposed indoctrination of the world from around heart until all that was left was a fragile organ that was all the more easier to break. He single handedly made my experience in academia 100% worth every moment.
"Online class. Very nice professor. Very helpful. Gives weekly forum postings (1 or 2 paragraphs) that are a big chunk of your grade, along with weekly quizzes on the chapter used that week. I suck at physics, so I didn\'t do too well in the class. He is a nice grader though, so no worries. Hard class to get into, so try and sign up ASAP."
"Gray made this online course appealing. Everything was fairly easy. If your into sports, take this course with Gray!"
I loved this class! Dr. Chris is such a down to earth guy and tells it how it is. Very honest and keeps class entertaining. Has tons of real life experiences and crudentials. Tests are difficult. Important to attend class and take notes. Only 200 points possible in the class!
"Excellent and inspirational instructor! One of the best tutors who works with students and guides them to become successful in their educational careers. She reads in class, give passage summaries, explains to one\'s understanding and has the patience of a saint! I will recommend her to any student struggling with English language."
"He is, overall, a relatively good teacher. He is EXTREMELY anal about grading on papers and stuff like that, but I think it should beneficial down the biology path. He\'s intimidating at times also, but just go see him if you\'re struggling."
"He\'s a nice guy, but his grading is severely messed up. I had bad speech anxiety in high school, but I gave it my all for this class. Still I felt burned by his grade despite my effort. Also he needs to realize that 4chan isnt funny."
He\'s easy. All you have to do is take good notes and the test is EXACTLY like the study guide he gives. I don\'t see how anybody can say his class is hard or fail his class.
"Boyden is the man. I took Hist of Medieval World and WestCiv 1 with him. He is definitely a character. He gets off topic with funny personal stories, but he gets the info you need out and if he doesnt bc he runs out of time, he wont expect you to know it anyway. Fair grader, fair workload, interesting well traveled funny guy. Cant say enough good!"
So funny. He is such a unique and awesome guy that knows his stuff. He gives you an outline on the board and expands from there so you\'ll take notes. But study for the tests are easy if you pay attention in class. I hope to take another class with him. Great dude.
Very good teacher. Not just speech but life lessons. I\'m walking away with great knowledge of myself and others. I have defiantly learned a lot from him. Great teacher and mentor!
She will really encourage you to come see her during office hours. She\'ll answer your questions but also is interested in you personally and will take the time to get to know you better.
Use exam prep guide!!
"You can easily tell that Mrs Joseph used to teach elementary or middle school. She explains everything like 3 different ways. Which could be great if you struggle with math, but if not, you will get bored. She does drop the lowest test score."
"I\'ve had wonderful experiences with Spanish professors at this school, so I suppose I was expecting something a little better? She has an annoyingly laid-back view of the promptness of grade returns. It would take a couple of weeks to get back an exam. She also is EXTREMELY disorganized and becomes aggressive if you call her on it."
"This class is pretty tough. Get ready to read chapters, assigned readings, hand written notes, read books, quizzes and comprehensive/multiple choice exams. Heavy content and he expects you to know ALL of it."
"This is the best chemistry professor I have ever had. In Dr. Bartlett\'s class you will learn not from powerpoint slides, but rather from him writing everything on the board in a lecture hall. His exams are difficult, but he definitely prepares you and tells you what to study. This professor is recommended by me to everybody taking Chem121 at UNM."
She is really easy to understand and work with. Very flexible if you try your best to work with her and let her know of any circumstances.
"Such a nice lady and an easy grader! This class was pretty dry, but you really learn a lot of valuable stuff. She isn\'t always clear about what she wants on the paper and assignments, but it doesn\'t matter because she isn\'t picky. Overall a very smart, kind woman. I would recommend her."
"Nice Professor, class was not hard, she\'s really helpful and seems to care. Test are graded right away and that really helps."
Takes time to answer emails and helps in any way she can. She is like a of a coach.
Glenn is funny but goes off on wild stories but I liked them. Bring a recorder because he goes through the whole test for you to study off of if you type out word for word. Going to take Phy Geo online because of work but wish I could take face to face ;0)
Great teacher who takes time to make sure everyone understand the material. Always available for help outside of class if needed. Best Physics 101 teacher for sure.
Awful..she\'s insulting and makes you feel stupid. She does not care if you succeed let alone understand the material. Very disappointing.
"The worst teacher. Rude, ignorant, and horrible at teaching."
"She is a mess, she glorifies herself too much. She is not a professional teacher, if you get on her bad she could be extremely rude. She has issues..."
"Dr. J doesn\'t like to use good notes. His teaching style, you will find, consists of him yelling and asking questions very loudly, and the class sitting in silence confused and frightened. I do not recommend him. His grading is also ludicrous. If questions aren\'t answered as he would have, regardless of having the correct answer, he will take point"
Homework is via LearnSmart. I highly recommend paying close attention to all the lessons and doing the Self Study questions as well. 2 exams and comprehensive final. Make sure to do all homework (they\'re easy enough) to get all those points b/c the exams aren\'t easy. ACCT program at North Lake is not in sync with the Online Learning -Not his fault
"SNORE. Monotone. Reads straight from her notes/textbook readings. If you can keep your eyes opened, you\'ll find that she\'s very knowledgable, just not good at educating. Read the text and you should do fine."
"Excellant Teacher. Knows his stuff like no other I\'ve had, is a very nice guy, and makes the classes interesting. Only problem is he sometimes stumbles on proofs, leaving everyone in the class staring at the board for like two or three minutes, haha. Then again, he basically makes up the proof in class."
Dr. Penton was very helpful and enthusiastic about the subject. She expects way too much for an intro level course and treats it more like a 300-400 level. Also she says in the beginning that she doesn\'t give over a 97 on any discussion which can give you an insight into how she grades. Tough course with ALOT of reading and writing for this level.
"He is very passionate about the subject and makes it relatable to those who aren\'t. He\'s young and I like feeling more ""peer-ish"""
Professor Bachkosky is excellent. She is very knowledgeable of the law field and is very effective in guiding students to do their work correctly. I hope I get to take another class with her!
This is honestly a great professor who is concerned for students to succeed. He makes his class realistic to what will be faced in our future careers. His personality is great! funny guy. I will definitely miss this professor!
If enjoy somebody who just puts you sleep by talking the entire time take her
"I feel awful that I didn\'t do better in his class. He\'s very hard-working and caring (I see oncourse updates put up even at 3am in the morning), but his lectures are confusing. Test questions are needlessly complex or ambiguous. You have to sort of learn his ""language"": decipher what he means from what he says. Old exams are your best study tool"
"This was such a bizarre class. Bahti is so unclear on her assignments but expects so much from it. The study guides are useless and the powerpoints a mess. Bahti would show up in a million scarves and beads, spend the class clicking/twirling them, and then have us read passages from the book out loud. Very strange and not very helpful."
"Lee puts you in the spot and is not entirely friendly if you get questions wrong. He can be very condescending and mean-spirited. However, he does try to keep the class interesting. He also assumes you know a lot of vocabulary that I hadn\'t learned. This class made me feel stupid and I am not taking French again because of this."
"Won\'t upload lecture notes, which means you have to go to every class and write down all the xxxx yourself."
"Farrell has a sweet voice, but beware of condescending undertones. She is the toughest grader I\'ve ever experienced, her tests are ridiculously difficult, and there is little clarity in the syllabus. Homework has little to do with the test questions. DO THE MYMATHLAB PROBLEMS OR YOU WILL LOSE A LETTER GRADE."
"This teacher is very opinionated, he is a know it all, and while he welcomes your thoughts he is very demeaning if he doesn\'t agree with you. Do not take his class if you don\'t have to."
"She was very helpful. She gives you time to finish the work that is asked. Students need to study the material to pass the tests and always check Blackboard! Do the extra credit assignments, it helps!"
Come back to us Jon!
I definitely recommend that you take BUS 393 with James because he is by far one of the most helpful profs in the entire business faculty. His lectures are mostly based on course readings but he\'ll occasionally integrate his own legal experiences into his lectures. The midterm average was relatively low but the class is curved so it doesn\'t matter.
"easy class, but you have to attend every session. points are given for attendance, in class exercises, and participation. she hypes up the tests to be harder then they actually are. i passed her class with an A."
"Don\'t Need Readings. Ignore Oct 07 Review. Dates of EACH Dec-Exc posted in Syllabus, just don\'t ditch on those days LOL!. In addition, there\'s 3 Extra credit opportunities. to make up for up to 3 missed Dec-Exc. \r \r Easy Midterm, Easy Final. \r Read online notes, goto Discussion, skip Lec unless there\'s a Dec-Exc. Got an A/A+ that way."
"I was not a fan of her teaching. She is very knowledgable on the subject. I did learn a lot of interesting information. However, she does favor the spanish speaking students, as you will see, and she will sometimes go off speaking spanish in class. Hard to follow if you aren\'t fluent. I was bummed to se that grades are based on her liking you."
Definitely don\'t recommend this class without a strong prior foundation of calculus. She teaches way too fast in lectures and tries to cram in so much information in one lecture. Midterms are fairly impossible and the true and false questions only drag you down. Quizzes every week in section. I don\'t recommend this class at all.
"Professor Engles: great writing teacher. He boils things like grammar and commas down to easy-to-remember rules; my writing has improved in many ways! I\'m also glad to get a better idea of how ""professional"" writing differs so much from what we learned all thru college. He\'s enthusiastic, sincere, and the conferences are a big help. Great class!"
"He was extremely helpful during office hours--will work with you if you\'re having trouble, and give you credit for extra assignments. I would take him again if my major required it!"
"avoid if you can, class is torture"
good stuff...pretty interesting and real crappy funny jokes that no one laughs at but himself...but still kinda funny i guess...real good prof tho
"Very particular, either likes you or doesn\'t. Plays favorites. Teach\'s different from all other MASC professors. Hard grader, prepare yourself to be bashed during critique\'s of work. It\'s a shame she is the only one that teach\'s it. Good luck with the class!!!"
"So many readings... Threatened us with quizzes if we didn\'t start reading, but never followed through with it."
Dr.Allen is a boring teacher. I had her for lab and she was never there. She does not explain things well she just repeat herself. Run from this professor.
"If you really are horrible at Math and need a starting place, I would definately recommend you take her class. She is very helpful and cares about her students."
"Keffer was a great teacher when it came to presenting the material. However, his tests were unnecessarily hard. I studied every day for his class but somehow he still managed to trick me with the way he worded his test questions. There are 2 huge tests that cover so much information and then the final. Study Study Study"
"Attend the lectures, don\'t take accounting on-line. The content is difficult, but Mr. Brown explains it well and takes his time with each new concept. He uses real life scenarios to explain concepts. Exams and quizzes are mostly from his lecture notes, not the book, so attend every session. He allows you to use your notes on quizzes and exams."
He lectures on about one topic but other than that he s a good professor
He gives you everything he ask of you online nearly organized. He is very thorough grader but tells you exactly what you will be graded on for each assignment. If you bring your paper to him and ask for help he will make sure you get an A on the paper.
Greg is beyond amazing! He\'s incredibly easy to understand & clarifies if needed. His tests are easy if you do the practice test & listen in class. He\'s always there for his students. He plays The Colbert Report nearly every class. He jokes with us & makes economics class worth going to. Favorite teacher by far. Wish he taught more subjects :)
"Awesome prof. Very approachable, makes the material fun and interesting. Lots of mini assignments to be completed in groups like exercises!"
"Obviously, Redekop like to rate himself. Is he kidding? too sad"
Always tells you exactly what will be on tests and gives great study guides. Makes the material interesting and entertaining. Engages the class very well and was one of my favorite teachers I have ever had. He is extremely passionate about what he teaches and it shows.
"I really her Prof Christolear! Not that many people liked her in class, but I loved her! She was clear, understanding, and very very helpful! I thought I would end with a B in the class, but I luckily got an A-! If you work hard on the work and essays, you too will achieve a great grade! IF you have questions ask her!"
Incredibly hard to understand. He gets mad if you ask questions. He might be the worst teacher I ever at at MU
"Good teacher. Tests are hard, but if you study and do your work, you will succeed."
"This was my favourite class this semester, but it was super challenging for me, but still a very interesting class. Class attendance was your participation grade as well. Her assignments were a bit unclear, but if you asked her about it, she would hand feed you all the information you needed and then some."
"Sociology is my new religion, and he is its prophet"
"I found Chung\'s class pretty easy, but fairly boring. Kind of repetitive. But Chung is a really nice guy. His bad jokes are the best! I didn\'t read the book for this class and I still got 90\'s, so you probably don\'t need it."
she is a very good teacher..i would highly recommend her if you have trouble with english.
"Dr. V is awesome! Some people complain because his tests are ""hard,"" but if you study, his tests require just using logic. Take his course if you\'re interested in geology. He applies the lecture to current events frequently, and makes the material interesting!"
The course was informative. I learned many important features of computers in this course.
"American History Since 1877, online class. 2 papers due based on the online notes and reading material from the books. Midterm and final exam were both ""take home"" and included detailed rubrics of what the professor wanted. Read the notes, give the information from the rubrics in the papersexams, easy A. :)"
"Well she does her notes fast and explains but she\'s kind of hard to understand, you need to self teach yourself most of the homework to get a good mark in this class. I would recommend this teacher to people who are self motivated and like teaching themselves and if your not don\'t take her you\'ll fail"
good teacher.
wow this is a history class...not a music class. Yeah we play pipes in class which is not fun at all...but this guy is real sincere. the only bad thing is that he is unclear. You might want to know a little about music before you take this class or it will be confusing
"Vary fun teacher just has a great time teaching up in front of class and you will learn a lot from him. However, he is generally harder then some other teachers so if you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to learn don\xe2\x80\x99t take his classes"
"Pretty easy A. All you need to do is print the slides before class and you\'ll know everything. He lets you use a cheat sheet on the test, and gives a huge curve."
"Dr. Casper is seriously an amazing professor. He is interesting, relatable, hugely intelligent, hilarious, and clear on his expectations for the class. Five 1 to 2 page papers throughout the semester, and a quiz or in-class assignment almost daily, which are very easy if you do the (usually short) assigned reading. Very willing to help students."
"I had Thorpe for my BIO 120 lab. I liked Thorpe overall, and there were plenty of chances to do well. There were quizzes at the start of every class period to review last weeks material and he answered questions very clearly. He helps with the big paper that is a large portion of your grade. It was a tough course, so there is a decent work load."
class was interesting and Chavez is very funny
Ms Kennedy is very smart- alec and sassy. She plays around a lot but it\'s cool because she really is funny. She is very educated and knows her stuff. She is not a teacher who will baby you though. She gives a lot of second chances for you to do well and all in all I think she is fair. I recommend her. If she knows you\'re trying you\'ll pass this cla
What happened to him? Did he get fired? He wasn\'t that bad.
"Her class is super easy as long as you do the work and take the time to perfect it to your best ability. You are usually given more than enough time for class activities as well as for homework and essays. Although certain criteria will seem pointless, by the end of the quarter you will more than likely realize how much you learned from her class."
"As a music minor, I would recommend trying to take as few as possible of your classes with Dr. Davenport. He knows his music, but also thinks his students know everything as well. He uses power point as the basis of his test, but never put them online. To many he can come across as condesending and unopen to others opinion."
Great teacher... very VERY willing to help you... he comes an hour before class for those who need him... helps u out with the TONNES of homework if u make the effort to come early and ASK... Lots of homework and tests though... be brepared to work hard... He doesnt grad too hard... tests are multiple choice and a few problem questions... STUDY HAR
"She\'s the ""Math Goddess"""
she\'s so enthousiastic about the subject- keeps the whole class really engaged. Hard paper grader- do the readings b/c they\'re really interesting
"Excellent Professor. He not only knows what he is talking about, but helps you out in anyway he possibly can. Just an all around genuine person. Take him for any class and you will not be upset with your choice."
She is an amazing teacher with excellent experience. She has many work in multiple galleries. She knows what she is doing and she will gladly show you and teach you her skills. You have to respect her and her teachings. Listen carefully to her instructions. She will expect a good work from you. You\'ll get the grade that you deserve. Gotta earn it.
"I strongly recommend taking this class, because I took Math 125 with this teacher a while back. His notes are clear and well broke down. Plus, his tests are easy and practical, rather then a big surprise which comes out of nowhere. I highly recommend this teacher."
"Gaughran\'s the man. His film courses are a great mix of the classroom text (which he uses enough to warrant buying, but doesn\'t smother you with), his own educated opinions, and your opinions straight out of your papers. Also with long gray hair, a chill demeanor, and an identical voice, he is a living incarnation of The Dude from The Big Lebowski."
Professor Perry is an awesome teacher. He is loud and humerus.I had an 8 am class and thought I was going there for an easy A for my degree and found the class thought provoking. He encourages class participation and lets you know that there is no wrong thing to say. He is by far the best teacher at Sinclair. I will take him again.
"Clinicals were gruesome, just because of the long hours and patient caseload. Lectures were boring and a waste of time, not her fault. Still had a great time in her class because I\'m graduating! Yeehaa!!! She is a very nice instructor and has a great sense of humor."
learn it by yourself
"This is the worst teacher ever. She made me seriously consider leaving my major (art) and the school. I wanted to cry every time I was in her class. She would pick on people and yell at them, and their is no way to get a good grade in her class. DO NOT TAKE HER CLASS."
This is seriously the most helpful teacher I have ever taken. I am someone who despises math and without him I would not have been able to make it as far as I have; finishing up calculus this term and it\'s all because of him.
She rocks! You\'ll learn more from her than from any other CU Accounting prof. She knows what she is talking about and is going to push you - but also encourage you. She is fair to all regardless of race or creed.
"He is great, clear and helps you learn a lot"
idk what ppl are raving about.. this class is so boring. i took it bc of these comments. she is a great prof but the classes drag on bc all she does is lecture. we barely do any group discussions. midterm was difficult but she puts notes online. quizzes are hard bc its either her answer or wrong entirely so thats frustrating.
"very good teacher. His tests and assignments are quite easy, and he is always willing to help students with any problems. A bit odd sometimes, but brings character to the classroom."
"Very helpful, knowledgeable, interesting person to communicate with. Lots of reading (3 really thick, but awesome books to read), but it\'s an independent-study class."
"Its very repetitive, but I won\'t question whether he knows his stuff...he clearly does. I don\'t know how much notes u need to add if u already have the course pack though."
"Dr. Moore is awesome! This was my 2nd class with him and even though his classes are challenging, he\'s extremely fair and very clear in what\'s he is looking for in assignments and quizzes. He\'s engaged and responds quickly to questions etc. Take his class!!"
"She\'s awesome. I have learned a lot and really grown in English. Lots of assignments so grade is pretty even. You an skip a few and I have a feeling she will let you turn those in at the end. Best English teacher I\'ve ever. A lot of fun and, just the best. For sure take her class, I will be next quarter."
Read the book and ignore the lecture!
Great Prof!
"Mr. Quarforth is Excellent. He is really cool and fun to be around. He makes VCU 101-102 easy as possible. I really enjoyed having him as my advisor aswell, I wish I could keep him until I graduate. He is young so he still knows what its like to be a college student, thats what makes him so great. He is also easy to talk to so don\'t hesitate."
Mr. Tom Daniel is a great instructor...he is helpful and is easy to understand! Gives extra credit points for tests and you know what to expect on the test...they are very fair! Please be punctual to his class and offer him a hamburger every now and then ;) *Had to put that in there Mr. Daniel! All in all a great instructor!
"He was very helpful, watched a lot of documentaries that really backed up everything that he talked about. Everything is very clear, textbook not really necessary, do the study guides and go to class and it will be easy. The tests are straightforward, he doesnt try to trick you"
"basically chem130 is about how HS chem was all a lie. Prof Hill is knowledgeable and pretty clear when he stays on topic, but has more than a tendency to go on anecdotal tangents (which was my favorite part of the course). He\'s helpful and easy to meet w on office hrs, but a lot of the concepts are very hard. Not hard to get an \'A\' tho."
"Nice lady, not a great instructor."
"Mr. English was extremely helpful, he has a great personality. I came to his office hours and help sessions every week and he actually enjoyed helping me. This class changed my life. Although the class was difficult, he helped me to understand it. I love astronomy now!!!"
Very boring class. The professor is nice. He just doesn\'t like to give an A. I would not recommend him. He has a weird sense of humor too.
"Dr. Kenny is a great professor and lecturer. His tests are very straightforward, and he goes out of his way and makes special office hours before tests. Even though 93 is required for an A, the class is still very easy. He\'s a really funny guy too; you\'ll want to go to class."
"His classs is very boring, I don\'t feel like I\'ve learned anything during the lecture. There are tons of reading."
"This was the first geology course i\'ve ever taken and I thought this was an easy course. You don\'t need to read/buy the book becuase he explains everything very well. His midterms and final are easy, basically everything from lecture.He also graded essay assignments leniently."
Really nice guy. The class was kind of boring but easy. \r Definitely recommend it.
This is one of the best professors I\'ve had. He meets with you individually before each paper and actually engages you in discussion! I took this class by chance but have enjoyed it more that I ever expected. I wish he didn\'t have to retire. Absolutely wonderful!
very lively and funny.
"Jan rules! His lectures are long and often boring, but forcing yourself to pay attention will undoubtedly give you better test scores. Your grade mostly relies on MasteringBiology (online) and tests. Completing his study guides and reviewing MB will make the tests a breeze. Interesting and nice guy, highly recommend!"
"Nice guy, helpful, easy."
"Ended up dropping the class based on email communications prior to the start. Be warned! Inflexible, rude, and not concerned with students who care to complete the course. Would not reopen an online exam for me because I couldn\'t afford to purchase the ridiculously expensive textbook and had to wait for a rented book to show up late."
"Probably the least helpful professor on campus. Requires a textbook, but then says that the book is wrong, and takes points off tests if you use information from the book. Horribly inconsistent grader. Could not think of a worse 100 level class to take."
"If you are a working individual stay away!! This teacher gives out wayy too much work, she doesn\'t grade fairly at all, if you email her with probs then your grade is even lower. I am an A student and I got a b in this class :( she graded unfairly for all the hard work I did on my final project. Her tests are crazy hard, read the fine print!!!!"
"No textbook! Let me just say, this guy doesn\'t have a negative bone in his body. (At least in a classroom environment) He is light-hearted, energetic, and truly cares. He presents problems in a way that actually has use in real life. I always dreaded conversions, however, we tackled the subject within the first week! Bro. Relieved my math anxiety!!"
Such a fun professor. I would recommend to anyone. He\'s not too hard of a teacher. I love how much feedback he gives and really like that the class is so involved. It is really fun to listen what everyone has to say and he makes the class funny! Awesome choice.
"Interesting guy, very nice, very respected."
"Professor Joseph is amazing. He truly loves teaching history and does his absolutely best to help anyone in anyways he can. He replies to email and any other post extremely fast. He\'s helpful all around the board. One paper for the semester and it\'s a fun one. He do not put any limits on anyone. If you show you can and are trying, easy A!"
"He\'s not a pleasant guy and looks so strung out. He doesn\'t know how to properly utilize time, and I didn\'t learn an awful lot. He rarely replies to e-mails asking for help, and when I ask for help in class, he acts like a jerk."
I love sociology and this ruined it for me. You are required to attend class once a week on top of online and she teaches nothing during that class time. Biggest waste.
Worst class ever. She needs to take a class on communication because she is horrible.
EASIEST CLASS EVER. I never went to class and always got A\'s. Review sheets have the entire test on them and she drops the lowest one. Sitting through class is extremely boring but it\'s definitely not necessary. TAKE AS A GEN ED!
"Professor Lyons is very inspiring and she keeps things super interesting by sharing her real life real estate experience and stories. During our class, I felt very excited about the Real Estate Profession, and I could see most of the other students were excited too. She gives great opportunities to bring your grade up and to do make up quizzes."
Great professor. I am glad that I took her class she really opened up my eyes to political issues. Hopefully I can take another one of her classes in the fall.
One of the classes where I have learned the most and have so much fun. Abby\'s class is something you have to do in your life. She is 24/7 available through e-mail and will respond in 1 second. Teaches the tools necessary to get you ready for the next level. Exams are tough but worth it. Your hard work will reflect your grade.
"He is very imprecise, ignorant, rude and vulgar to his students."
I loved this class. Most of the class was looking at different art. She\'s really enthusiastic and clearly loves what she\'s teaching. Attendance is not really mandatory but I actually wanted to go to her classes. The class was interactive and we drew and painted a few times which was fun.
Really very good professor. He is very active and teach student patiently. Listen his students carefully.
"Oh boy. Professor Ron is a real nice guy who is very responsive to his students\' needs. The problem is his lectures are incredibly dull and he moves at a snail\'s pace when going over concepts that the majority of students are already familiar with. Very boring class, but Professor Ron is a really nice guy and the class is really easy."
"Tough teacher, his test are NOTHING like his lecture. Took him for Linear Algebra, made NO sense. I left feeling dumber"
"Yes you have to read and write alot even in Lit 101,but thats what LIT is. Even so if you do your stuff it\'s not hard and he is an easy grader. He boring as rocks but still a nice guy."
"Took his junior topics class and it was pretty interesting for the most part. He sometimes comes off as condescending but he\'s very intelligent. If he lectures, his lectures really lack direction and if you are interested in something, you have to ask him because it may not come up. He gives you a lot of time to complete the paper and I liked him."
"I hated this teacher personally. He likes people to write very descriptive and comment on how things make you feel, and that is not how I write. He grades papers very tough. He is very picky on what he wants but he does tell you some things he doesn\'t like which is helpful.(I also am a little biased because this class of all classes ruined my 4.0.)"
She was an awesome teacher who knew her stuff and tried to make sure we understood it too. Most of the students in the class had had her for 108 and signed up for her again. Take this class!!
"I fell in love with her teaching at first sight. She made human anatomy worth my while and I would definitely take her again. I recommend her to ANYONE. I repeat... Anyone. Best professor EVER! Just remember to always review your notes everyday and you\'ll pass with an A for sure. And if you\'re struggling, she\'ll be there to help out."
"Take this class if you LOVE photography. Not an easy elective class, but you will learn from the best. Thanx for all your help Prof. S."
She def made a class that could be intiresting awful. her final sucks because her questions are full of to many words and don\'t make sence. and class participation should not count for that much!!!!! i know alot of ppl who hate womens studies now cuz of that class.
"Nelson is awesome! She gives explicit hints in class about what will be on the tests. There is stuff on the tests from the book that she won\'t go over, but the book is an easy read and can get answers from skimming. Do the study guides and you\'ll be fine. I felt very comfortable doing speeches. TAKE HER!!"
"I enjoyed taking this class with Skoog. You watch films every week & there is a lecture (with movie clips to show examples) beforehand, which I truly learned a lot from. If you are interested in learning more about writing for film, you will truly benefit from taking this class. She does her quizzes/midterm/final on Canvas. I would take her again!"
great professor
Proved that Temple was the right choice...
"What a joke, took online and was worst mistake of my senior semester. Just wanted an easy class online get a B and coast by. NOPE, made class pass/fail and got a P (C-)."
"He really loves what he does and what he teaches. It\'s a two hour class that\'s dimly lit the entire time so that pictures show up on the screen clearly, so it does get boring, but it\'s a very easy class."
He has a very heavy accent and he truly does not care about his students. He just shows up and talks to himself. I honestly hated coming to his class because he was the worst teacher I ever had. His whole class is made up of 5 exams and no homework or quizzes. His exams are very hard. DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASS!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Basiniski is the best professor I have ever had. He actually makes you do college work. He is helpful and professional. Study for his class and you will have NO problem passing. If you just want an ""easy A"" he is not the teacher for you. He actually makes you THINK."
"After taking a spectacular 1A professor, I don\'t think I learned anything new in this class. Fleming often goes off topic, in a lesson plan that is probably already off topic, while making students rearrange desks into a circle for a ""better discussion"". $25 grammar book is hardly used. ~5 essays. Hard copies only. Easy A, while cramming."
"Very great professor! She made lectures interesting and the work was very easy. Light homework, easy lectures, and attendance was not mandatory. Highly recommend her!"
Nice guy. Very concerned and respectful of students. Moved tests to try to accommodate as many people as possible. Tests are fair as is grading. Homeworks are usually hard though. Sometimes overwhelming. In-class is mainly proofs and derivations. Example problems done in class aren\'t very helpful on homework problems. A bit dry during lectures.
I took him in the summer and honestly I only payed attention in class which surprisingly I was able to retain so much information from only listening to him. He is honestly one of the best professors I have taken in my entire life. he makes coming to class an honest joy.
I was excited about this class and still enjoy nonprofit management. I felt that the content of this class was great but the application of it and the grading was boring and unattainable. This professor really wants to be a graduate professor and shows this with her unrealistic grading style. SO not worth the work. Even grades group project unfair.
"Nice lady, stuck with a hard subject to get undergrads interested in."
"I took Comparative Anatomy with Dr. Guffey. Probably my favorite class at Truman. She is extremely helpful. The lab practicals are difficult if you don\'t prepare, but you know exactly what to study before hand. Definately take this class if you are intrested in med/vet school. Dissections occur every lab."
"Really disappointed in this class. He taught nothing. On the first day of class he opened every assignment and basically said ""get the book and it\'s on you"". There were 8 Exams, plus a Mid-Term and a Final, plus one introduction paper called a ""Bio-Image"" assignment and one Semester Essay explaining Org Behavior to an alien. Paid to teach myself"
"Awesome. Super smart and explains things well. Granted I took a 100-level class, but it was very easy. I didn\'t have to study for her weekly quizzes and still did well. She\'s nice and eager to help. I would highly recommend taking her!"
"He has a strong accent. Tests are taken straight from online homework and he lets you bring a formula sheet. He explains a lot of complicated stuff that you don\'t need to know, so make sure to study from homeworks and write down the calculator steps. He is VERY helpful during office hours and best interest into making you pass, overall a nice guy!!"
He sometimes goes off a bit on random tangents but honestly he knows his stuff and the class conversations and discusions he gets started are great. After two of his classes I decided I wanted to switch to Soc as my major.
"This teacher is my favorite teacher ever. I had him for my core class. you actually want to read the books that are assigned because of his knowledge of the stories. He makes the class so interesting and i miss his class. Dr. Demarest, YOU ROCK!"
"I have taken Glass I and II with Conifer and she is an amazing teacher and artist. Don\'t expect to slack off in her classes though. She does not ""dumb down"" her teaching just because it\'s a community college. Show up on time, try your best, pay attention, do your assignments, and you will get the grade you deserve."
"Meri is a dedicated teacher--smart, challenging, and supportive. I really look forward to her class, and not just because she is so very easy on the eyes..."
"I\'m not invoking a cliche when I say that Prof. Rosano changed my life. If you demonstrate an effort to understand these difficult texts, he\'ll go out of his way to get you there. What you get out of his courses is the capacity to teach yourself. Worth every penny and every second. If you have any interest philosophy, get into his class"
She has been great so far.I am half way done with her class and it hasn\'t been bad. she is not strict on when things have to be turned in. She also allows you to revise your papers. I personally think she is a great professor.
"great class... learned a lot, didn\'t learn a lot too, but it was still cool"
She is extremely knowledgeable in the field. Her lectures were always interesting and put of effort into having dynamic lectures. Midterms and exams were not difficult if you studied well. The paper was long and took a lot of work but was interesting so it didn\'t seem that bad. Would definitely recommend this prof.
"She definately has an accent but if u really pay attention its not that bad. She does an ok job of explaining things if u ask but she really challenges u to think for ursrlf. She is willing to help and give more explinations or examples, but expects u to do the work. Recommend her for someone with a general understanding of algebra but definatley not for someone who is math illiterate."
Ok.. here\'s the deal.. go to class a make yourself listen to him.. get on the internet and read for 30 hours plus study the book (which u don\'t NEED and shouldn\'t buy)take 20 tests per exam... and u might get a B... anything higher is beyond my imagination!!!!
"I loved Wilson! He is really funny and he\'s always in a good mood. His class can be tough but as long as you go and actually pay attention, it\'ll be pretty easy. I recommend this class!"
"Lacy is a great professor! He is always very passionate and is truly interested in what people have to say. He cares about his students and always wants to help you do your best. He has a lot of credibility and knowledge and has actually lived in Africa. A+ Do the small assignments, they really boost your grade."
"This prof completely sucks. First of all, he does not know how to teach. Second, he does not know how to prepare properly. Third, his assignments are so confusing. Fourth, lecture notes are useless. Please think before you take this prof."
This guy is my favorite teacher and friend. Anyone needing ethics credits should go out of their way to get into his classes.
"I took English 1b back in 2008 with Kevin Cook as my instructor. The class was difficult and Mr. Cook could be harsh at times, but this only pushed me to work harder. I have since graduated from UC Santa Cruz summa (won\'t let me write) laude in a writing intensive major. When I think back on how I got here, I remember Mr. Cook."
"She was awesome and hilarious. She really wants you understand the material and will make her two tests reflect so. Tests are hard but if you do the study sheet and flashcards she recommends, its alright. I managed an A in this class. I was amazed since Politics is not my thing at all"
"Took her a few years back for Government. She talked about herself more than the material. Was in the hospital & had to miss an exam. E-mailed her and was told that I could not make up the test, so I nearly failed an easy course. She was VERY discriminatory, also. She made me and a few others feel uncomfortable in the class."
"Lots of notes, but so worth it as the lectures are very informative and important to learn in this world. A very nice person too."
"I find that Samantha is not who she poses to be. She puts herself out there as a caring, accommodating teacher.. when in fact she seems almost callous, in the most discreet way. Her lectures are extremely boring; I\'m shouldn\'t be spending money to listen to a teacher ramble. Her test reviews are non-existent, does not know how to manage time. Sad."
"For one he makes you work for the grades, Weekly Quizes(60% of the grade) and weekly homework. Finals are easy as they are mostly based on weekly tests. Miss the class and discussion and you will definitely lose track as to what is happening. Gives good grades in the end provided you do decently in the weekly tests and submit all the homeworks,"
"This professor is for public speaking classes. Class is not difficult. Students take multiple choice tests and give numerous speeches on various subjects. Definitely not difficult for people that know how to talk. Also, a great class for people that have difficulty speaking in front of a group. Great professor and helpful critiques.."
She\'s pretty cool and laid back. She is a little unorganized but overall you\'ll love the course and she\'s not to the point where she loses your work. TAKE THE COURSE you\'ll love her.
"Weekly quizzes are difficult, and ask questions not fully explained in class. Really should go to class because learning from Bert is the lesser of two evils compared to the textbook. Stuff really isnt explained too well and there is little review for the material. Would have felt very underprepared for exams if I hadnt had past exams."
"He knows his stuff. Loves class participation, and he adds that into your grade. Tests are all take home. No reason not to get an A in his class."
Outstanding Professor!!!!!! I would take ANY class of Tom\'s multiple times. Excellent teacher
"This was a very difficult class, half of the students dropped out by the final. Prof. Sullivan is a wonderful teacher though. She is accessible to her students, I recommend going to her office hours and asking any questions before exams. If you are struggling, attend SI and make a study group with other students from class."
"Very enjoyable class. If you do the readings, the online homework, the practice tests, and so forth, then you will succeed in that class. The tests are straightforward. There are no tricks. If you can\'t answer it then you haven\'t understood the homework or practice tests. This is why you should go to office hours to clarify what you don\'t know."
She\'s very organized. She\'ll help you but you have to make it happen outside of class. You need to put forth significant effort to understand material. Her tests are a lot harder than first-level course tests should be. This isn\'t an easy class. The averages of two tests were 68%. Lots of work. Worst class of my semester. My classmates agree.
"Labs are ttoally unstructured. Good luck guessing at what you\'re supposed to study.. I mean memorize. If you memorize the wrong things, you fail. If you guess right and memorize the right things, you pass. Save your money. You\'ll learn nothing in this class."
"John Breyer is my hero. I had, and to this day, have no interest in geology, but I would take more of Breyer\'s classes any day. He doesn\'t use the book; just pay attention to the slides. Study them like crazy. The final is really really hard, but if you do well before it, you can at least walk out with a B."
"She was great. Thank god she talked. The rest of the people in the class were barely literate. And why is a class being ""very easy"" a good thing? Oh yeah, I guess it would be to a bunch of illiterates."
"What an obnoxious professor. Assignments are vague, class is beyond boring, and he arbitrarily assigns grades based on his impression of your ""participation"" in the class, regardless of your actual assignment grades. Avoid this classprofessor."
He is hilarious and likes to use curse words during his lectures because that\'s his style of teaching. There are only two tests during the course along with one requirement to read both textbooks in full. There is no clear agenda with the course and we watch movies most the time so I\'d say it\'s an easy A
"Outstanding prof! She teaches clearly and helps students build good skills. The class is about as difficult as a well-taught AP class in high school. I studied about 2 hours per week for her class (and went to class) and and easily learned material for tests. She obviously cares about good teaching, an unfortunate raity at UMB."
"He is the worst professor ive had at temple. whatever you do, switch into another class. take any other professor that you can. he thinks that his view on something is the only acceptable answer. he grades extremely hard and basically wants you to fail."
Take this lady. She knows her stuff and teaches in a way that is understandable. The tests and quizzes are based on stuff you do in class and if you attend and do the readings you WILL learn . There\'s a alot of discussion in class and you really go into the ideas behind things.
"The class about the three different scientific paradigms of Freud, Copernicus and Darwin was excellent. I will always remember te elements of that class. Enssle took time to bring the class forward through some complicated theories. As we moved through them he kept each of the theories in context with the others. Very high level teaching, not stale or monotonous. A great pic. Take him while you can. He is one of the greats.- Eddie"
"I really like PR and I really like Jennifer. The class was pretty fun and easy to understand. Her new GIS unit was the hardest part, but everything averaged out. Go to class!"
Hatfield is a seriously cool guy. He\'s the head of the dept. and makes a point to know everyone name in the major. His class is pretty easy if you go to class.
Just an awful experience. Teacher was very rude. Quiz reviews were not helpful. Instructions to papers were very unclear.
"One of the best teachers your going to meet at any college. Not only is Gipko funny, but he\'s extremely well informed and easy to talk to. Anyone that goes through Duquesne without having him at least once is seriously missing out."
"Hybrid Audit class. She teaches the first half of the semester, and the rest of the half is devoted to presentations. Easy enough. A few EASY extra credit opportunities, drops lowest test grade, and HW (one problem a week) isn\'t graded (though helps for participation grade). It\'s hard not to enjoy a class taught by someone who loves it so much."
"Took her for into to Bio and she was a very good teacher. She knew the material very well. Make sure you do the practice tests, because it is almost identical to the test. She also explained everything so you understood it all and remembered it. Lecture could be sometimes boring, but she was pretty creative in teaching the material."
"Promotes class discussion and is open to new ideas and critiques. Helps you get a grasp on the meaning of the material. Tests are quite easy, just simple memorization multiple choice. I highly reccomend taking a class with her."
Do Your Reading assignments and take notes because when you have a reading quiz you can use your notes. DO THE READING. don\'t be lazy and it will be super easy!
"Duncan is a tough prof, but never unfair. Many people do not understand his Australian sense of humor and think that he\'s being mean, but he\'s actually quite funny in his controlled sort of way. He wants students to succeed, and doesn\'t extend deadlines, but it teaches you to be on time with stuff instead of slacking off. Work and you\'ll succeed."
"Rittberger is a great teacher. He is such a sweet guy. He would do anything for his students. I would definitely recommend taking a class with him. He is helpful if you need it. You will need to buy the textbook, but the class is really great."
"Good teacher and a nice guy. He was very busy during the semester because he also goes to college himself and teaches high school, so he is slow to grade, but pretty fair overall. Not difficult or over abundance of work to do... I would take him again."
"Professor Maple is a very caring teacher. Easy accessible. Gives great feedback to better yourself. Group projects, essay papers. Book used. Very respectful. Cares about students. If you are having any trouble just email her and she will do what she can to help you. She gives words of encouragement and pep talks to her students to keep motivated."
"I have had Dr. Meyer for both psych and law and business pyschology. both classes were enjoyable experiences for me. he is a tough teacher, but a student can easily earn an A by paying attention, following his detailed study guide, and earn easy bonus points in and out of class."
"This class was so boring, although very, very easy. But if you don\'t need to take this class, then don\'t. It\'s not worth the time."
"The class isn\'t even remotely about what it was described as during course signups. All he does is talk in his monotone the whole class. Not very engaging at all. We only have a few graded assignments, and he doesn\'t give any feedback for them. Not very helpful when I ask him questions outside of class. Thank god he\'s a visiting prof."
"The lectures were pretty easy to follow however all the tests that we had were harder than what was in class. He over helps with homework by explaining the whole thing in class. Gets too involved in lecturing that his back is always to you, so it is almost impossible to ask questions. Tends to make mistakes and review sessions are worthless."
good news!!! he\'s not going to teach next semester :)
"Gives no exams, just papers. Papers are unclear on what to write and his lectures are hard to follow at times."
"Pleasant and approachable. Concepts are difficult, but you will be OK if you see your TA\'s out of class to understand the material."
"Doc is a great teacher and he is pretty hilarious to watch, especially when he starts yelling out stuf like ""Choc-o-late choc-o-late choc-o-late"" when he\'s counting out loud. Good guy, without a doubt."
"Such a funny guy. 4 tests, and 5 papers. Totally duable. Tests are easy as long as you study off the notes. I enjoyed his class"
"In Coffelt\'s class,you get what you put into it. If you are too immature to understand his sense of humor,too lazy to do homework,or are expecting an easy A,this is not the class for you. If you need to actually learn math,he\'s the prof! Always available and helpful. Grades on a curve,so averages aren\'t anywhere near the 40\'s. And he\'s cute too!"
"I took this course as an elective. So far I am going to the final exam with a 95 average. No risk tests are fairly easy to do well. However, Waugh\'s teaching style is terrible. Not recommended."
"Was told I could never pass but did with an A. He is tough but very fair. Never heard him mention AL once and I loved his stories and jokes, it kept my attention. E-mails are long but contains info I needed. My boss loves my memos now. I am glad that I did not quit the class like a few did. Stick with it and I promise it will pay off."
"She is terrible, her voice will make your ears bleed. Drop her at all costs."
"Wow this guy was a HORRIBLE professor. His lectures were not only boring but uninformative. Whenever a clarifying question was asked he would just restate his original statement. Outside of class, he seems completely uninterested in you, both as a student and person. Of all the psych professors I\'ve had (my major) this guy is far and away the worst"
I had Carnes for several accounting courses several years ago. Get on her good side. She loves you when you are an A student and will disown you if you become a C student. She can make or break you when it comes time to interviewing your senior year - remember that as a freshman. Good luck!
She is no nonsense in her approach. She can be harsh but if you run into problems she is extremely fair - just ask her if you need something! Will generally cover one chapter a week. Do not miss the first day of class each week and review the material as it is assigned - Mathews likes classroom participation during lectures! She loves programming!
A+
"Run as fast as you can. I might understand being upset if you fail this class. I had a ""B"" and I\'m upset. She tends to say one thing and write something else on a regular basis. I feel the class was a waste of my monies. Never in class the whole alotted time generally 20 to 30 minutes early. She never seemed ready for class and would fumble trying."
She\'s a tough grader but I\'m glad I took her. I learned a lot and is willing to help you out. She says she\'s one of the only teachers that gives a lot of quizzes and essays but I guess it was for the best. Take her if you want to learn how to write well.
Horrible teacher. Thick accent. Confusing grader. Stubborn and wont admit to being wrong or give in to demands for a curve. If you want to do well you\'re better off teaching yourself. Around 75% of the class dropped. stay away if possible
"Online tests every weekend over the lectures. If you pay attention and take good notes, the tests are very easy. She is very funny and her classes go by very quickly. Highly recommend her class. There was no review for the final but if you did well on the tests, you should do well on the final."
This class was great both in regards to the professional aspects of visual communications and the history. It also helped me develop basic skills in brain-storming methods and developing an eye for things. It is a great class!!
"AMAZING! I was trying to add this class along with about 30 other people. He took our info and went out of his way to track some us down as spots opened up! I added after about 10 days and he gave me everything I needed to get caught up! When exam 3 came, I had a family trip and he went out of his way again to schedule a make up! Take him!!!"
"took as a night class, kept us THE ENTIRE TIME and we all wanted to kill ourselves by the end. Sometimes took up to 2 hours to go over the home work. We fell behind the syllabus and wound up only learning about 1 chapter for half the semester. Our midterm was on stuff from ITA 103 combined with the 1 chapter we learned. nice guy bad teacher."
She just reads off the powerpoint. The way she asks the questions on the tests are confusing. Doesn\'t help you when you ask her a questions. Advice: take with someone else
Pretty hard but you get used to him and you learn a lot.
"She is very knowledgeable about religion. She makes it understandable, but lectures get a little repetitive at times. She gives writing conferences for the papers and tells you what you should do to get an A. Very helpful and nice."
"This guys is really cool, his class is easy and he is a really cool guy. The only thing is that sometimes he talks a bit to much and the class gets lost since the begining.. Either way I passed and got a good grade.. I would recomend to anyone!"
Great teacher. Treats you fairly. Keeps class interesting.
"He is a jerk and cannot accept flexibility. He does not allow students to express their opinions. He is egotistical. If you haven\'t heard before, you should know before entering his class ... there is no fuzziness. I would not recommend this class to anyone."
"(EPY 8200)Dr. Anggoro is extremely knowledgeable and passionate about her area of expertise and research. She understands her students arrive at her class from all walks of educational backgrounds and does not expect her students to leave her class as experts, but to have some understanding of the latest, cutting edge topics in cognitive research."
The class was hard because we only met once a week for 3 hours. She would assign A LOT of reading and then gave a quiz at the beginning of class. There were only 5 questions over 50+ pages of reading. it was easy to fail. She gave the quiz before lecturing the homework. Her lectures were unorganized and she clearly was not familiar with the reading
Mike is a great guy but this class was a mixed bag. The lectures are more like discussion and there\'s no real structure to them. The quizzes are difficult but fair. My biggest problem was the final: there were problems on it that were NEVER addressed in the class or in the reading. Other than that it was a fun class. He\'s a chill and funny guy.
"I\'m not sure what everyone is talking about either. He\'s really not hard to understand at all, and he\'s a sweet guy. If you fail your test he\'ll let you retake it and the test isn\'t bad at all. He wants you to do well. I think he\'s a good professor."
"Talk to him before dropping a class, he\'ll help you out."
"great teacher, very VERY clear.TAKE HER if u can. very lenient, just talk to her if u miss an exam. go to class she takes attendance everyday! optional final to improve grade. missed the first quiz and still got great grade. TAKE HER!"
"Webb can be a great professor depending on the class he\'s teaching. This Westward Expansion class wasn\'t one of his best. He spent so much time talking about the impact of events that it seemed like he missed talking about the events themselves. He\'s a nice guy and for the most part a good teacher, but avoid 4250"
SHE IS THE BEST THERE IS! SHE GIVES FULL NOTES AND HELPS YOU WHEN NEEDED...WILL GO ALL THE WAY TO HELP YOU PASS...
"Extremely tough class. Show up to class because he will purposely put in-class only material on the test if attendance is low a particular day. Tries to be helpful, but he seems to get defensive if he doesn\'t understand what you ask him or if he thinks you should already know the answer. Got an A but had to study my *** off for it."
BEST CLASS EVER!!!!!!! It\'s fun...it\'s easy!! The classroom itself is worth taking the class. It\'s like a movie theatre :)
Carol is an excellent professor who cares about her students and will go the extra mile. I have taken three classes with her at USM and would highly recommend her. She is one of the best people I have known here.
"Wow, where to begin. This class had NOTHING to do with Spec Libs-it was about competencies, finding a job, finding a job, competencies, & did I mention competencies. Her syllabus was poorly written, her directions unclear, and definitely could use a refresher in interacting with other humans. I do NOT recommend this class."
"I was on Sandra\'s good side; she was nice and understanding as well when I was having problems that were making me physically ill. However, I saw her as very rude to some of the other students. During a critique, Sandra angrily asked a student ""are you disagreeing with me?"" when they liked an area of their piece that Sandra did not. Not okay."
"A LOT OF HOMEWORK!!! Even though you study hard and finish every assignment, it didn\'t mean you can pass the course. You will have draft 1,2,3, but she will only rise your mark a little bit.However, she is nice and willing to help you in the office hour. In my course, the rate of students who can go straight to ENGL 1100 is only 20%."
"Seems to know what he\'s talking about. Outlines exactly what everyone on set does. Midterm. Group final (filming , he gives you a script) Gotta play with a dolly. Decent sized handwriting just needs better pens almost all dead. Kinda funny, shows a youtube series detailing cool shots. TLDR Actual Cinematographer is helpful in Cinematography class"
absolutely frightening that she is a nurse!
"Excellent teacher. Teaches Graduate school the way it should be taught. Makes sure you understand material and gives you practical experience instead of alot of ""busy work"". One of the best professors I\'ve ever had."
"Mr. Mostafavi is quick returning emails. Although he does not solve the lab for you, he provides hints that are useful to write your codes. I was very impressed when I found out he actually published a textbook in programming"
"Great teacher. Knows his subject. Available and wants to help. Pays attention to which students put in the work outside of class (open laboffice hours). Tests are very difficult, but grades on a curve. Offers a ton of extra credit. Will have to study for an A. Access to old tests in SLC. Only need to buy ""Selected Topics"" and ""DeFiore Atlas""."
"I love Dr.Shea!!! She is a really nice lady, funny, and a great lab teacher.Has the coolest Halloween tights"
Good teacher
Such a good professor..He makes class so fun. You will not ever regret taking him. You will never be bored and he lets class out early. Extremely good professor. I would recommend him to everyone!
I took prof Rosenthal in the fall 2010. He\'s the worst professor at Salem State! He doesn\'t care about his students you could go to his office every day and still barely get a D. I graduated school with a 3.95 gpa do yourself a favor take MAT 108 or any math with J. Lampes you\'ll be glad you did. This guy hates life!
"Very clear and easy class!! She gives pop up quizzes on the readings, but she also asks for feedback on the books for future reference. Love her!"
"take him, he\'s an AWESOME guy and he makes you think but he\'s an easy graders as long as you do the simple assignments. There\'s a lot of reading, but he goes over all of it and it\'s very clear"
I would not take Ms. Bibus. She makes a lot of jokes but is not a great teacher. i studied a lot and earned a C. She gives these papers we have to write and expects unrealistic things. i was very annoyed in class and always dreaded going to this class.
Go to all your classes and prepare beforehand by reading the material since there are pop quizzes. He likes it when you participate in discussions. I thought my grade was going to be lower but I got an A and was pleasantly surprised. Actively participate and be read all material. Good teacher.
She is the greatest professor of all time! She gives easy assignments and they are very interesting! She is always willing to help her students and attendance doesn\'t count. Do your readings & assignments and you\'ll do fine! She\'s always willing to give extra credit to help boost your grade. Easy A!
"This class is reading and writing intensive, so be prepared. The essays are called ""reflections"" but they are really small research papers. She provides great reviews for the test, so if you study that, you\'ll be fine. Lastly, she provides most of the readings via blkboard, although there are 3 books we had to buy (or check out the library)"
"great prof!!!!!!doesn\'t give you hard time, as long as you go to class and do the work ,you will be ok. he gives a midterm take home essay and a class final plus he Gives you the definitions. you just have to memorize it or a little cheat will help a lot........"
"She is easy, she gives you the study guide for her tests along with the answers. If you can\'t get MyPsychLab she tries her best to help you get and KEEP your grade up (AKA she works with you) if you just take a look at her study guide, you\'ll pass her class, even if you just pay SOME attention yocan pass, you just have to want to. I\'d recommend her"
"This professor is not good in the least bit. Sure, you can become his buddy and be a friend, but as an instructor, I don\'t even know how this guy got his PhD. terrible intstructor and exams are taken straight from the book, so make sure and read"
"good teacher, super nice, easy class... but do keep track of ur grades she tends to loose track of all her things..i thought i had an A but according to her.. her grades were accurate i ended up with a B.. even though the my grades were all A\'s"
"Gerard is a great teacher for any marketing class, but his passion is in sales and managment. He is a caring teacher that will stretch the limits to help you in your studies and in your personal life. Douglas is lucky to have such a great teacher. Take him while you can!"
"One of the WORST teachers I\'ve had at Clemson. Not interesting to listen to, doesn\'t respond to emails about the class etc. The test\'s are all online but hardly on the material covered, you can look up a lot of the answers on wikipedia... average grade still a 40-50 only redeeming point is he curves ridiculously."
John Anderson is the best senior lecturer I have ever had. He has travelled all over the world and knows his stuff. I really enjoyed listening to his real life stories and experiences. He has an open door policy and is always there for his students. I can\'t say enough about him! You must take one of his classes!
"His teaching style left much to be desired, he seemed to do no prep work for the class at all, the labs were very poorly thought out and the Taymoor refused to help us understand them when asked. He also seemed to punish the class whenever someone did something he did not like."
"Excellent instructor!! Not easy but, show up, pay attention and study, you\'ll do great. Janie will tell you exactly what\'s expected of you and if you know your material, the material that she teaches very well, you\'ll do great! Love her classes. Wish she taught more of them."
"Really a difficult teacher, not because her material is difficult, but because 10% of her info is inaccurate (conflicting directly with text), and because her tests are clearly over things she has never discussed that are not in the book (and I write everything down). Really seems like a teacher that does not want her students to succeed."
"Professor Valdina is an amazing person! I learned so much from this class and received incredible feedback from her! If you are reading this, I truly recommend you to take her class! She has a passion for Literature that brings you into the content! SUPPORT OUR CAYUGA PROFESSORS!!"
This class is all about writing papers and discussion forums. Not difficult to pass with a B if you do the work. Difficult to get an A as the grading criteria is very unclear. She seems to be just throwing darts for grades
Professor Lerra is excellent. Great lecture and the exams are not difficult. Learn a lot from him. Would definitely recommend.
Wow. I can\'t say enough bad things about Johnson. There\'s only a coursepack and it has a typo every three words. I\'ve learned more about Lloyd Carr than about macroeconomics. Why couldn\'t he have retired a semester earlier?
"Great course! Provides lots of flexibility and choices to suite your writing style and preference. An excellent elective for anyone interested in writing, whether it be business letters, travel writing, or a children\'s story. A must elective and will help to improve your writing. You are given a TA who marks your work, but Martina was helpful"
"Overall, if you somewhat study, pay attention, and do all the events she asks for, you will do great. It is easy to keep an A, but she is hard on attendance. You are allowed to gain 2pts. to your final grade through some way of extra credit."
"Dr. Collins is an awesome professor. He goes out of his way to help you, including extra office hours, homework help, and even test corrections (if you do the suggested problems). He even understands that you might have other courses that are killing you. Hands down, Dr. Collins is the nicest professor I had at MSU, and his class was fun."
"she is terrible, rude, incredibly hard and way too demanding. she REALLY needs to chill and realize its a 100 level course. this was the worst class i have ever taken in my life. i would NEVER take her again. take her if you REALLY want to work and have thick skin."
"I\'ve had lots of chemistry professors, AVOID THIS LADY LIKE THE PLAGUE! Hands down the worst professor I\'ve had at Parkland. I\'m a 4.0 student, I\'ve taken a ton of science classes, this lady will keep you out of grad school. Boring, fincky, ineffective as a lecturer, and loves to preach to students like they\'re children instead of being helpful."
The best of the best! Take him!
"great instructor...very nice, helpful, and modivational... & she knows her stuff"
"Very fun class, learned a lot! Was very knowledgeable in all aspects of social media and creating SEO content. The Google tests are hard to pass yet valuable for resume; study hard. Going to miss these great informative classes!"
Great class
"I never enjoyed math until I took his class. I studied hard, but the reward was great! I actually understood trigonometry. He was very patient, and a great teacher."
He is nice and knows his stuff. Don\'t listen to what others say : that he is mean etc. You have to know your Micro. well. Fun class I would take it again if I could!!
The absolute coolest professor ever.
"This is a challenging class. You need to remember basic concepts and strengthen your algebra and calculus (differential) skills. When there\'s something I don\'t understand, I ask her and she explains it to me clearly. Very helpful and considerate. Good teacher!"
"Very unique professor. He is like a walking thesaurus (this is a compliment). Knows lota of history among other things. The way he communicates with students is good, but sometimes it falters because of his age, but overall, I would recommend him."
"Christine is an awesome professor! She will stay after class to help you if you need it. She will even outline the chapter for you to help you prepare for exams. This class is tough, lots of material, but if you do the assignments and just listen to her she TELLS you how to get an A! I recommend her."
"Donald Thomas is a rude butt hole who is only interested in his paycheck and not helping his students. He doesn\'t even answer your questions in a complete sentence, more like a 2 word response. He makes you feel like you are bothering him when you ask him something. The class is easy. I made a 96."
I really recommend this professor. She is very helpful advice for writing papers. She has a lot of knowledge in her field and she really wants her students to do well in her class.
"First day of class I thought she acted a lot like Edna Mode from the incredible. She looked a lot like her and acted a lot like her. Talked incredibly fast and had very strict rules like NO CAPES!. In short, if you like to readlearn from the book, take the class. Otherwise, you wont like her. other descriptive words: condescending, pompous,dull"
"This teacher is awesome! He\'s friendly and helpful, you learn a lot and it\'s not boring at all! He has guest speakers and he talks a lot, his assignments are really interesting and it\'s really not a lot of work, so long as you attend class!"
"Useless, does not teach at all, and is not helpful to students. Speaks very slowly and is very boring."
"Very nice and helpful, this class was interesting and the essays are easy along with the weekly quizzes and discussions."
Great prof but very hard.
Ms.Barnard has been known for making smart comments and making a person feel incompetent. She does not like to explain and she forgets often.
I had him for Pastoral Epistles. He told a corny joke every day and requires a 10+pg research paper and 8pg+ commentary...ugh
"by far, the worst teacher I\'ve encountered at UCI. avoid taking him! his tests are impossible and he\'s an unreasonable grader. his lectures are boring and whenever he\'s lost or doesn\'t know what to say he just substitutes big words"
"Really fun teacher. Very passionate about English literature. Took her hybrid class this semester, very computer literate which is nice. Easy A if you put forth the effort. You have to read though so be prepared."
"I\'ve had Kate for two classes now and she can be a tough grader at first. She truly does care about her students and is passionate about what she teaches. Hard work pays off in her class, I learned so much from her! She packs a lot into her lectures so attendance is important! Overall I highly recommend taking her courses!"
"Her knowledge of using computers is lacking and needs help from students everytime she uses it. IF SHE IS GOING TO USE A COMPUTER FOR CLASSTIME, SHE SHOULD GET HELP BEFORE CLASS STARTS. Tests are very hard. Memorizing paintings and names A MUST. Takes attendance for 5 minutes + setting up projector 15 minutes. CLASS IS SO BORING."
"SAM IS THE MAN. Hands down one of the best professors I have ever had. He is hilarious and always kept me interested. He cares about his students actually LEARNING instead of grades and tests. I have never had a more understanding, passionate professor. TAKE HIM I PROMISE YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT."
"Tough, but fair and very supportive. Generous with extra help and coaching. One of the best."
"Easy class, she does take role and has class no matter what. Alot of homework and listening asssignments but they aren\'t due till midterm and the end of the semester. She is helpful and answers e-mails...take this class!!"
"A good teacher, it\'s a little boring, but she teaches you well and prepares you for the material on tests and quizzes. Weekly quizzes and homework every night.There\'s never an exception to homework, you always have it."
"He is a really great professor. He wants his students to do well. He will help you with all of the quizzes, homework, and semester project before you turn them in."
"Dr. Mitchell is awesome! She makes you work for your grade, but she\'s a good teacher. She\'s always there to help and really loves the Lord. I still go see her some now just to say hi!"
"she makes this class interesting, and you can definitely see her love for the subject in her way of teaching. she is a cool lady."
"DONT take her class!, she just reads the power points very loud and obnoxious, gets annoyed when students ask questions about HW. She adds math problems even when the course books do not. Doesn\'t help outside of class, and is rarely in her office except just before class. Becuase she is SO loud we are all sitting in the back of the room now."
"I actually really enjoyed Professor Silver. Although the material is hard, and he may not be the BEST professor in the world, he generally cares about his students. GO TO HIS OFFICE HOURS. He\'s incredibly sweet and loves to see that students care. Be prepared to work, but it is not impossible. Asked a ton of questions and got an A! He\'s a great guy"
"She is tough but somewhat flexible, although she doesnt deviate much from deadlines. You have to turn in stuff on time, otherwise points will come off. She can come across as mean, but she knows what she is talking about. She will make you work for your grade."
"This professor is very nice. She is clear in class and really is able to communicate the information well - but - tests are tricky. This class is definitely worth taking - however, be sure to seek clarification. Overall, nice person; decent educator."
Great instructor with a great attitude. Made me reconsider my non science major with her enthusiasm and knowledge of the subject material. Motivational speeches that i will not soon forget. Seems the students who resented her were only bitter with their own low grades or her refusal to favor them over everyone else. will definlately enroll in A&P
"Probably the hardest A&P professor at USC Aiken. Expect 2 quizzes twice a week, which are harder than her exams. The questions on the quizzes are not straight forward, and some of the questions on the exam could seem as if there is more than one answer. However, there are 5 exams/ practicals. Expect to study every day for this class."
This is far and away the worst and most **** teacher that I have ever had.
yes.
"He taught the class as if we were all graduate students stuyding History. There was too much reading. If you really put the time in you could do all right i believe, but not me. it was too hard for me. so i dropped it."
"Always late. You are guaranteed never to get a mark as to how you are doing never mind a project brief before VW date! hello? anybody home? Please wake up and come on back to planet earth. There is only two more weeks left of studio, there is no time to do all of what you are suddenly asking. Bite me."
"Rea was an amazing ASL teacher, shes very close to the deaf community and if you show interest, she helps bring you into it. Shes funny, and genuinely wants you to learn and love ASL. Chances are, if you dont like her, its because you did poorly in the class."
I wasn\'t sure to take this class or ENGL 90. This professor was very helpful and I earned college credit!
"I\'m a mature adult with a degree in business. Decided to to back to school for Allied Health. In all my college hours, Mr. Wann is by far the worst professor I\'ve had. I didn\'t receive financial aid, but paid my own way through. It was very frustrating to sit through class and listen to him flirt with the cheerleaders and drone on about nothing."
"3 class assignments with excel, access, and another. He gives out study guides. for tests, Every class their is an class assignment so sort miss class you will get behind. Sit near a computer, Offers extra credit and wants you to learn. He can get a little boring but you can learn so much from him. Very sweet, caring professor, and funny."
"Awesome professor!! He keeps class very interesting and doesn\'t take it too serious! You need the book to do small homework assignments, but there is nothing else due other than that until the end of the year."
"Richmond definitely fits the classic description of the kooky professor, so Special Rel with him was a fun class which went by way too fast. That being said, he teaches the same material from his website every year and you could easily not attend a single lecture and ace the (2) tests."
"He didn\'t like me, I didn\'t like him. His quizzes are much harder than what is shown in class. When you try and ask a question, he likes to insult your intelligence and has a tendency to want people out of his class rather than in his lectures. He seems to always want to start conflict all of the time. Would absolutely not recommend."
"He\'s an awesome teacher. I know he tries his best and wants the students to pass. If you make an effort, he\'ll pass you. I have a world of respect for him."
he\'s the worst prof u can ask for . does nothing in the class. just goes over his notes like a machine . no use in going in the class. better of sitting at home and reading from the book
Content is not hard but he does do a paragraph long written assignment almost every week.
"I\'ve had Lynn for 2 classes now and I have to say she is informative and very helpfull and understanding, she brings a personal perspective to classes using real-life example. She is among the top in her feild, and a great person and awesome teacher"
"Teacher wasm\'t helpful, seemed annoyed when asked questions. You need the textbook to complete online homework, but he never referenced it in class. Lectures were never really related to the homework. There were also a lot of technical problems with the online homework, I ended up hating the class. Think twice before enrolling."
"Let\'s be clear...I despise math but with Ms Powers all of that changed. Now I just hate math when she\'s not around. Excellent teacher but don\'t think she\'s soft because of her age. Don""t be late and don\'t cross her."
"I love Leslie! I have had her for drawing, 3D, and art history. She is super helpful but if you don\'t try , you won\'t do well. She does say she keeps attendance but she\'s not super strict about it! Love that we had a ""meeting"" halfway through semester. Awesome person, great teacher, super east to get along with, love talking to her! Take her class!"
"Hard class but he make it fun and easy. one of the best professor in QC. first choice in Tax class. Review sheet before each exam. exam questions were similar to the review! super, super Hot!!"
Really great prof. HW load is minimal. He is a genuinly nice guy. Content wasn\'t that interesting but he was very passionate about it. I would take him again if I had the chance.
"Dr. Chinnery was by far one of the best professors I have ever had. She is completely easy-going and understands that your grade matters. Her tests are so-so; multiple choice, fill in the blank, short answer. Remember the path-ways! She gives extra credit every week and s forgiving with spelling mistakes on assignments. Make sure you go to class!"
"Best teacher, very easy going and wants to help students to learn!"
SOOOO HOTTTT!!!!
"Amazing professor! He really challenges every single student to excel and reach their full potential. Only people who want a free ride would complain and should probably drop out of college altogether. Hardest course I\'ve ever taken, and the most rewarding. I got an A, but it didn\'t come easy. Absolutely worth the effort!"
"The lectures were difficult to stay awake in, but helpful. The debates were not too bad. Takes attendance, so plan your absences accordingly."
"An extremely understanding professor. Our final paper is 8-10 pg and some students couldnt finish on time so she extended deadline b/c she understands that we have to work. She taught us grammar and how to read quicker, very useful! honestly, was tough cuz its a winter class, but she\'s there every step of the way! Take her to if you want to learn!"
"An amazing profesor, teaching relevant, practical and interesting topics about construction. She makes the topics interesting and she uses a lot of humour whilst doing it. Karin is a really great teacher and it is obvious that construction world is her passion. She is extremely knowledgable and experienced in that area."
"Great Guy. Heiland is passionate about his field and it shows during his class. He will bend over backwards to help you with a homework assignment or a question on the material. He is always willing to sit down during office hours and will help over the phone, or via email. His exams are challenging but he is a flexible grader. Highly recommende"
"Yo, this professor iz the best from the rest and iz a future hall of famer at fiu. No book required for dis class and he gave us 2 mad ez assignments that takes 15-20 minutez. Read a whack article once a week and rap about it at da studio. Real aweome professor and i give him 5 thumbs up for his awesomeness. Take dis professor if u need this class"
Class was decent. He tries to get students to understand the topics and also tries to get students involved in the lectures. Has a sense of humour which makes the class a little bit more relaxed. Tests were okay if you study as well. Attendance is not that important but he explains the content better than reading from the textbook.
Very easy! Only had 5 assignments. Gives you a good outline on how to write an essay. I wish I could take another of his classes! This class really improved my writing. I would definitely recommend him.
Habib was a pretty good prof. We wrote ALOT of essays and our finals were VERY easy. Some of the lectures were very boring however some caught your full attention. He is very easy to talk to and loves to answer in class and out of class questions
"He\'s a great professor hands down. If you go to him for help he really encourages you and is honest with you on where you stand. Lots of class participation, and definitely be comfortable with talking and writing in spanish, but you don\'t need to be a pro"
Best prof. I ever had. I learned alot from taking her course. She Rocks!
I have had Professor Wright for both financial accounting and managerial accounting. For both classes I must say she was the best teacher I have ever had. She is someone who dedicates her time and effort to help you succeed. After all she was the reason I changed my major to accounting.
"Go to class! Very nice, and very helpful! One of the best math teachers at USF. She gives a review which is very, very, helpful! Ask for help if you need it, and she will gladly help. Good luck!"
"Professor Douglas does not give, or take away, points for showing up to class, but if you do not show up, your grade will be affected. He is very light-hearted and makes this Speech class A LOT less nerve racking. I would take him for another class, if I could."
Awesome prof. loved her.
This man took a simple ISS class and turned it into hell. He was a worthless professor. I learned nothing and gained nothing from his class. My friend had the same class with a different professor and had a great time. I felt physical pain at the thought of going to this class. DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASS!
Pairs you up with a classmate every class and you work together to write sentences based on what we are learning. She is very helpful and grades writing assignments fairly easy. It helps that the class is half online to boost your grade. Overall good teacher.
This is an extremely easy course consisting of only 3 short (4 pages double spaced) papers and attendance. Victoria is an extremely frustrating prof though. Hard to hear in class and sort of just goes on in rambles that you have no idea what she is talking about. Terrible communication through email and hands papers back extremely late (months).
This is not a good professor i took is class back in 07 tough he fail me. Makes class very hard please avoid this guy at all cost. I re took this class and got a B. I don\'t know what those other students was smoking lol maybe he has changed his ways over the years a touch from a supreme being i guess ? Dont tell this guy you want to be a nurse tell
"Very hard class, but she\'s accomodating."
"I was born with the math part of my brain on the outside of my body. When I first met him, he took my freakish external math brain and eased it back inside my skull with a satisfying ""squish"" sound. Then, he sung me to sleep with an indian lullabye. One of the best teachers I\'ve ever had. If I can get an A in his class, you can too."
"By far the worst professor I\'ve ever had at SLU. Not clear on any assignments, has no clue how to teach and never answers emails. Just because you have a Phd, doesn\'t make you an educator. Seriously thinking about joining another Grad School program because of ""professors"" like her. Just awful."
"This was a super fun class, but the tests were pretty hard. I was able to pull a solid A with the extra credit. Interesting info you\'ll use for personal use!...2 midterms, 1 final, panels, which were interesting."
"He yells a lot and goes off topic, and be prepared for his cussing but don\'t take it the wrong way. He gets the message across but by the end it is an easy class. Inspirational as well."
"Awesome! Well-organized, clear, helpful, and enthusiastic. Assignments take a lot of time, but they are interesting. I would definitely recommend taking any course that he teaches."
"Mr. Bell is a wonderful professor; he is organized and punctual. I added the class a day late, and he was very gracious in letting me in. He is the most attractive professor I have ever had, and it is not just his outside appearance that I am referring to. Mr. Bell has good character, is a gentleman, humble, and caring. I loved attending his class."
"Very helpful, but not an easy A. I really enjoyed this class and gained a lot from it. If you don\'t already have at least some interest in the field, you will probably get bored and want to drop. She\'s also smokin\' hot."
"Really nice guy, good teacher. Had him for two semesters. Would definitely take a class with him again. I liked that his full-time job is in the ""real"" world and he can share actual experiences in class. The only negative is that it seemed like the second half of the semester flew by and we ended up going through the last chapters very quickly."
"The instructor is rediculously strict,hard on tests, and if one asks for help,he would assumes he does not know what it is. Plus for the lab module its very difficult to res art if you don\'t pass on the first try since the new modules would pile on top the failed lab courses within a certain time limit(very strict limits). No substitute courses."
Spectacular!!! Love this woman! Makes class really fun but you still learn. Exam after each chapter and a final. Not hard at all though. Just study the vocab and review some of the grammar and youll be fine. Also very helpful if you have a problem.
"Jim is my FAVORITE man in the world and the best teacher at Emerson by far. He is the nicest, most helpful, and most intelligent person I have ever met. I\'ve taken two classes with him, and can\'t wait for more. I\'ve gotten more out of one class with this man than a whole semester with some others. He completely changed my view of the world. Looove."
He is a nice person but he is not logical and coherent in his lectures. Woodstock or the seventies did its work. lol
"Although there are only 4 tests in the class, they are your only grades. Class is not mandatory, but if you miss class you better get the notes from someone because he tests straight from lecture. If you take notes, make sure to write down stuff that\'s not on the powerpoints, 9/10 they are on the test. Ask questions and make study groups!!!"
She is a very intelligent lady and will help you whenever you want. Just a bit boring
"good guy, has interesting comments regarding material. the course curriculum is pretty cut and dry. there isn\'t much to complicate. tests are straight forward and in line with the notes proved in class. will offer easy extra credit. this was the easiest ""A"" I\'ve ever earned."
"He is clear, if you can hear him. His lecture style is to copy a sheaf of notes, verbatim, onto the board. Although the homework problems come from the textbook, use the text only as a backup to the excellent lecture notes by Prof. Fung. Exam problems look like Fung examples. Z not much help to individuals, but straightforward."
"Mr. Harrison is a great lecturer. I found the class to be very interesting. He is very knowledgable and is a good speaker. The downside to his course was that he had some attendance issues, and he did not grade papers in a timely manner. His study guides for the tests are really difficult, but if you study extensively, you can make a good grade."
Had him for both 0330 and 0370 after being out of high schoolgirls 20 years if you do your homework come to class and participate you will do well.
Mark mayo is the best bio professor you\'ll have. He\'s chill and is willing to help. Make sure to study his lectures!
My guardian angel. Makes you accomplish what you never thought you could.
"There are 9 writing assignments, bi weekly AP/Grammar quizzes, and in class spelling exams. You need to buy the AP book. The class is difficult but you learn a lot. Definitely make a group chat with fellow class mates, it will help tons. Prof. Pinto speaks very low and she is sweet but catty at times. Participate and you\'ll be fine!"
"Mark is such an amazing instructor! He gives great lectures, and is always there to ask questions if you need it. One of the best at CNM for sure!"
"Very accessible professor. Web-based homework (graded) and exams were tough. Read textbook and understand example problems from text BEFORE you go to lecture. Follow his study suggestion, work the problems and you should do well."
"Lecture is slow and repetative, and is filled with lazy YouTube searches for relevant manufacturing videos. No clear expectations for what to know for exams. Homework is all from the book, but is graded slowly. Everything must be typed, no handwriting, ever. Prof will not directly answer questions during review sessions."
"I had him for an honors class freshman year, the best! He\'s so nice and understanding. If I had a chance, I would take him in a heartbeat. He really cares about the student, and wants them to do well in his class!"
wow i thought i was the only one that thought this guy\'s tests were impossible. good to know i\'m in good company. if you have him get out while you can.
"Professor smith, is a nice woman but a terrible professor. There was was very few things graded, most of what were quiz readings that had nothing to do with the course. The test had to be regarded every time, she probably counted right answers wrong. Her teaching is just so scattered and unorganized."
"Terry is very helpful. Class will definitely be beneficial to you because you\'ll be writing lots of research papers and you have to learn how to cite properly which she teaches you. You learn a lot of interesting stuff even if you know nothing about the environment/global warming. She\'s really nice too, and sends out lots of reminder emails (good)"
"I had Dr Rivest for 112,114 Eng. He leaded me through Eng by using clear explanations,Power Points,vivid examples, for each type of essay he created papers with Thesis, topics that helped me to write essays. My questions were adressed.Knowledge that I obtained in his classes helps me in writing papers for other classes.He is The Best Eng Teacher!!!"
"This guy\'s nuts! Take Mr. Schneider and learn everything you ever wanted to know about loosing weight, Viet-Nam, open heart surgery (This one has video), what to do in an emergency, and, Oh yes, a couple of things about computer science."
"yea he is nice but he is annoying and a horrible teacher!!! i didnt take clac in high school and struggled in this class! does not explain well at all! talks to much for no reason! but he drops the lowest of 3 test grades, u are allowed to bring notes to all tests, and no midterm"
awesome dude. grading is very fair. do you work and your readings and you will be set. he\'s pretty cool once you get to know him.
Hard material. He is a cool funny guy but Do not take him. His voice is so monotone for an 8am class. Don\'t need the textbook because Everything is online. Does not explain material thoroughly and then grades tough. Oh and he is not hot.
"He did not show up for class twice, but still hits students on their attendance and tardiness. He has given the same lecture twice in a row before and I have to wonder if he is professing for the class or for himself."
Good prof. Take him
Very helpful professor!
Jill is a joy. Her lectures are inspiring and her classes are the only ones that I\'ve actually had insightful discussions. She knows so much and has so many stories. Take her class!
"Dude does not give any of your papers back at all!! when asked how i was doing in class he responded ""Don\'t worry, no one in here is in trouble"" WTF!!"
"This stuff is hard, but she is really entertaining and funny and she doesnt take s*** from anyone."
"AVOID IF YOU ACTUALLY WANT TO LEARN SOMETHING ABOUT HUMAN SEXUALITY. Just awful. Yes this class is an easy A, but if You would learn absolutely nothing about sexuality. This class was all about politics, society, advertising adult films, clubs, products, etc. and a little bit of simple sex ed that everyone learned in middle school !"
"Professor Martin Laba is an excellent professor. He is charming, funny, and well-informed about the materials he is teaching. He cares about his students, and he is easy to talk to. Great class to take and listen. Listen and be engaged is the key."
"Math has never been my strong suit, but Scott Adamson came highly recommended to me by other faculty, and they did not lead me astray. I feel that I really learned the material without having to sell my soul to do it. Extremely helpful and available in and out of class time to help. If I take mire math classes I will build my schedule around him"
"Professor Hagen did appear confusing at times, but if you paid good attention in class, he did provide you everything you needed to know about upcoming assignments. He is very knowledgeable about his field and is very willing to help those who come to him. Dedicated students will earn good grades. Hagen prepared me well for Honors English 112."
"Take this class! Great fun-lovin\' teacher who thinks he\'s ""Rainman"" Makes learning fun!"
"The workload in this class was ridiculous. If you want to survive this class and stay among the sane, then look for another professor."
Great teacher. She takes time to explain problems that students may have questions on. I would take this teacher again.
"This guy looks like Zack Morris 20 years down the road. Nice guy, thinks he\'s funny at times, goes too fast, but will help you if you need it."
"Hi, Very good professor. She explains everything you want to know about math. She is extremely professional and accurate. She is very lovely and empathic person also patient with her students. I will give her 5 stars."
"Professor Schouten is an amazing teacher. Make sure to take notes, especially when he is giving examples about how he wants your papers written. Follow directions on what he expects from your papers and you will pass. Also participate, even if it\'s a couple sentences, be on time."
"Fin108 is such an easy class. Gallatin got off topic a lot, but he made class enjoyable. He really knows his stuff. He not only uses the text book but he adds his own input as well about financial issues. Quizzes and tests come straight from the power points, so just pay attention and you\'ll be fine."
"I don\'t know why the previous 2 wrote negative things, but I feel as she is easy and quite helpful. She likes to interact with the students"
I hate math so this was a hard class anyways.... but then it was even worse because he teaches how newton doe stuff and forgets to tell you the easy formulas. He knows that he is talking about but just can\'t get it across to students. Bad teacher
"Very nice guy-EXTREMELY TOUGH CLASS. It\'s all opinion based, and if your opinion isnt on cue with his, you get the questions wrong. Very knowledgeable but he is not good at conveying the message to his students."
"Doing your homework on the day that it is assigned is best for having an edge in this course, as the grading criteria is mostly percentage wise and this can hurt you if not completed. The exams cover EVERYTHING from the smallest things in the lecture notes and especially in the textbook. Taking good notes is incredibly important, enough said."
"Perfect professor for the course. Very good at openning up discussions for the class and nudging them along. Open-minded enough to allow for various student types while structured enough no one can claim ""I didn\'t know what he expected."""
"honestly, I loved the man when I first started out at school. But since he wrote his book, it seems as though his dedication to the students has gradually gone to the back burner. Its a bit annoying and a shame"
"She is very rude and her lectures are boring. There are only three grades for the whole semester, which are three tests online. The tests are open note and open book, but are very hard. If you get a bad grade on just one test, your grade is done for the semester since there are only three. Don\'t buy the book. Don\'t take her."
this guy is the****! he is extremely talented and loves to teach! watch him perform and he will amaze you...
"Dr. Foret is by far my favorite professor. He gets off topic and talks about his family a lot, but he\'s very sweet. He takes the time to work with students. There isn\'t any homework, unless it\'s for extra credit. The lab manual is a must, the textbook is so-so because he makes slides with all the info. You should go to class, it makes your life"
Lectures can be boring but are important to attend. She gives a lot of handouts in class that help a lot on homework. Sheri really cares about her students. Sometimes lets you work on quizzes together and will give home one take home exam. Also offers a couple opportunities for extra credit. First exam is challenging. Would recommend.
Amy is the best! Just skim the book and memorize the lecture slides for the exams and you will get an A. She gives 10 points extra credit for research studies. She makes lectures interesting and is funny.
"Great teacher, he makes Physics fun and interesting. You do have to study for the quizzes, but the questions on the exams usually follow the quizzes. Do your self a favor and study the quizzes for the exams and everything for the final. I could not believe how many of the questions were the exact same."
"If you want to seriously learn something about business communications go to Leslie. She is fun, but takes her class seriously. Fair marker. helps with all the assignments."
The professor doesn\'t give alot of work and when she does give work it is only one or two questions. Projects are near to none. The one thing that I like was the fact that she always tryed to create an interactive classroom experience basically everyday. This made the 2 and a half hour class less strenuous and a bit of fun sometimes. =]
Stressful at times. There\'s a lot of work but he will help you out
"she just cannot explain anything, and is completely unapproachable and unhelpful outside of class"
He\'s a funny guy. You do 90 percent of the work in class with little homework. You know exactly whats on the test before you take it.
"Great prof. Full of energy, laughs & keeps you highly interested even for non major students. One of the best I\'ve had at IUSB."
"He is a great guy, who is always willing to help. Questions after class or during self-extended office hours, all okay. Expect to attend every class to learn the material, the book is good for nothing but seeing the homework problems that you are assigned."
This guy was an entertaining speaker and I thought he was hilarious. His exams were straight from the study booklet so they were a breeze.
"These courses are designed for Sweet\'s students to become exposed to many noncanonical writers as well as many different forms of writing. While her forte would be poetry, she is able to shift into interpretation given cultural influences and demand excellence in her students writing and the impact of writing in others lives in any order of style."
Hall\'s class isn\'t too bad if you\'re good with taking notes as you\'re lectured at. His power points are useless because there\'s info on there that he skips and will take about things ahead of the slide. At least he offers extra credit to make up for some of the bad grades.
"If you listen to everything he teaches, you\'ll pass. He has a good sense of humor not one of those professor\'s that are very serious. Only bad thing is that he pushes lecturers till the very last second of class."
"Class is base on 3 essay and multiple choice exams. Very tought grader on the essays. If you pay attention in class and ask questions there is no need to read the book. He looks scary at the beginning, but once you get to know him he is a very cool guy. Would definitely recommend him, if I need to take another class with him I would do it."
He is a great guy but his class was not very interesting to me. The tests were not bad but you had to know what you were talking about. Not the best lecturer but he tries.
"I thought she was a great teacher. Very lenient with deadlines, and very easy to get along with if you know HOW to talk to her. Don\'t talk about gender issues or the female race, and you\'ll do swimmingly."
"every quiz and test question is from the powerpoint and everything is online. If you don\'t get an A its your fault, super easy. Also you actually learn something, she\'s a great teacher and makes it super interesting and you want to go to class"
This class is beyond easy. If you study her powerpoints and do most of the reading than you should make an A in the class. She is extremely helpful in class too.
"mr Chang is not bad, some of his exams are a little hard but if you study hard you will pass the class."
"Whatever you do, do not ask her any questions within the classroom. If you need to ask her any questions go to her math center because then she won\'t drop kick you in the math center"
I really enjoyed her class. She was really clear with her expectations and is more than willing to help you with whatever you need. She does lecture a lot but class discussions are encouraged. She also helps you become a better writer which is awesome for a history class. Not to mention her side face profile is to die for.
Textbook is a must. It is a tough read with its age but is needed to pass the class. Dr. Dan does make witty jokes during class.
Tracy was by far my favorite professor this semester. She is so clear and inspiring; I didn\'t mind waking up for her 8am class. She cares so much about her students and wants them to succeed. I highly recommend taking her class. Stats in itself is a tough course but she finds a way to make it interesting and relevant.
Not very helpful and seems to belittle students.
"She doesn\'t know how to pace a class; you cover 2 chps. a week, she constantly changes the syllabus (a day\'s notice for hw), & her lecture slides are extremely long and she ends up skipping through them. Tests are group+ind, but hard as hell; not material she/book teaches. Class feels rushed, unprepared, and leaves students having to fill in gaps."
"I would not wish it on my worst enemy to take his class. He shows favor to certain students and knows everything. First hand is forewarned. Lutz, Fischer, and Aferdita are very good and caring instructors. They treat ALL students the same."
"Relied more on my previous knowledge from highschool physics to get through this course. Sometimes confusing, NEVER USE ANY ELECTRONIC DEVICE IN A LECTURE (exception: calculator). Definitely knows her stuff, doesn\'t necessarily present it as well as it could be."
"He is an extremely intelligent professor who loves Soc! He didn\'t give any homework, there was only 4 exams you were graded on, plus a project that was a nightmare. No extra credit! If you don\'t show up at all you definitely won\'t pass since he teaches you everything in lecture. He is sometimes hard to understand but you get use to it."
"AMAZING CLASS! From first impressions, to the very end, I was never bored by his lectures about humanities, the arts, and history. The moment I walked in and listened to the first lecture, I can tell, this professor knows what he is talking about and is very into the course he is teaching. Take his class, but expect to write a lot of notes."
guy will drive you nuts with his knowledge but he is a fair grader i got a B in his class but to get an A you have to participate and pretend like you care lol
"I took this class online, there\'s no homework but 4 test and 1 paper. He is tough at grading the paper. He does not give you enough time for each exam, in some exams he give you less than a minute per question."
"I had him for american studies with scott saul and they are both just as bad as one another. This guy asks really weird questions regarding the subject in question and expect us to answer. If we can\'t, he presumes that we did not study and imitates his ""golf swings."" No Joke ! He does his golf swings, more like goof swings, and wait in silent."
"She\'s nice, weird, and the class it easy. However, if you write a paper for this class and dont put like 1000 commas in it, you will fail. This class is an easy A, Dr. Pollock is really nice, just remember to put thousands of commas in your papers."
"Engaging and enthusiastic (to the point of jumping up and down) about his subject and teaching. His breadth of knowledge seems endless, and he\'s very personable. Excellent."
"Why would the school let this teacher teach ""Counseling"" classes. She discourages students and probably is the reason for many drop outs. She is a complete power hungry B!%@# and I really hope she gets it handed to her when she finally snaps and hits a student"
He\'s pretty helpful. Always answers your questions.
The class was mostly boring but professor Bayoumi was easy going. The readings each week were very lengthy. The semester ends with a class final website on immigration and an in-class exam on certain topics he tells you about. Not bad of a class
"She\'s an ok professor, but she gives too much homeworks. However, she does give you a chance to make it up. It If your chinese she expects you to know more. She gives quizes like every week. She also gives extra credits. She does make the class fun and interesting. This class requires work so it\'s no easy A"
No pasa nada... Professor Morgan is brilliant and so is his class. I think I love him!
"She is an interesting teacher. She gives you lectures ahead of time so that you can read them and take notes, and then listening to her makes it easier to memorize. essay quizes and tests, but she gives you the test essays a week ahead of time. you have to study, but if you study, her tests are VERY easy."
I had her for a day and I did not like her at all so I changed class. I knew her and I would have a problem
very helpful.
Best teacher I\'ve had!
"This teacher is all over the place. Bring earplugs, and DON\'T print during class."
"Horrible. His class consists of him moderating a discussion about his book. The class centers around his book about the ""top ten"" media myths. His paper grading is subjective, I think he wrote more comments about what was wrong with my paper than I had written on the paper itself. A pompous man. Do not take."
"Teacher does not provide much, if any, feedback on speeches. Fortunately she allows manuscript speeches, and is the only teacher to do so. She is maybe a bit over-critical of speeches and work, but in a class that is relatively easy, you can manage a decent grade as long as you read the syllabus and study up on what she speaks of."
this teacher either likes you or doesnt. i had her for cis 150 and cis 250. i was new to typing and didnt do very well because the tests had a lot to do with typing speed as well as knowledge of formatting. i did better in cis 250 and i think she was a totally different person once i got a grip on the subject matter. like her as a teacher.
"You have to work hard in her classes, but most of the points come from assignments. If you come to class, do your homework, and turn in your assignments on time, you will get a good grade."
She is awesome. Do your readings and you\'ll have nothing to worry about. She is very knowledgeable of the humanities. Excellent instructor.
Please take Elaine Karls because she makes English interesting and fun unlike how the public school system makes education out to be.
"Former Navy Corpsman, kick ass teacher and all around good guy. I\'ll second the other comments on here, you have to put the work into his class, but if you do good things will come of it."
"He warns you in the begging that you will work... That is not a lie. He answers questions, and truly cares about his students. If you are ready to work, take any of his classes. I was very engaged the entire time! He is very detailed and there is a lot of reading."
"I shall never doubt Rate My Professor again. She disappointed me. I basically taught myself. The only teaching method is reading each chapter in the textbook. And she ""tries"" to do (few) games, but they didn\'t help. At least papers were only one page and opinion-based. She was okay in the beginning, but I found her to be condescending by the end."
overall a good guy. very tough grader as has been posted but you just have to adjust to how he wants you to write which is specifically for math. he is very smart but is very set in his ideas. I would recomend taking a class of his just because you learn how to learn in a different way as well as the course material
"The comments are kind of funny. I can imagine the kids who sat in the back corner of the room checking their Facebooks all class getting a bad grade, then coming here to cry about him being unfair. Participate in discussions, write the essays, talk to him about bad essay grades (he lets you rewrite them) and you got an A. Interesting guy and class."
Professors are two types: Type one: mainly does research but has to teach on the side so they teach a class it because they have to Type two: does research but also enthusiastic about teaching and making a learning environment. He\'s type two
nice guy
"AWESOME!!! Eric is a great professor. I would highly recommend anything he teaches. Makes learning fun and interesting. Easy to remember everything he teaches. Very knowledgable, even though he had never taught the class before, he did a great job!!"
She is very HARD! She is difficult to understand and is very monotone. She does give extra credit. She can be very short with you if you ask questions during lecture. She will help you if you show her that you are trying to do well. Very hard tests. YOU MUST STUDY to pass.
"I recommend his class because he really try his best to cover the material efficiently as possible. If you really want to learn something, he is the guy! Be prepare to work hard and don\'t miss his class! He will make fun of you if you are not serious or don\'t do your work in his class."
"Dr. Crozier very good teacher, very helpful as well. He is a great advisor too, he will make sure that you are on track when he advises you. Nice person too :) Dr. CRozier is AWESOME!!!"
Pretentious Twit! So phony she makes your teeth hurt. Avoid at all costs.
"Scored lowest grade in Law since 1st year. Not b/c content or that it was a \xe2\x80\x9cchallenging\xe2\x80\x9d class. Experience shared by a fellow student who was a TA/Dean\xe2\x80\x99s List. Not receptive to having marking questioned. Lectures unanimated and talking-head. Little provided as alternative interpretation to textbook. Recommended \xe2\x80\x9ciff"" (if and only if) you have to"
"Prof slow at first to answer emails; got better later on. VERY slow to grade briefs and tests, except for final. Briefs were hard. Exams not bad due to study sheets that told you what essays to expect. No class interaction at all (eg on-line discussions). Basically you taught yourself the material. I did learn a lot, however. I got an A."
I took her a while back (but just now rating her) for both World Lit I and II. A very enjoyable experience and I\'d take more of her classes without a second thought.
My friend and i always thought she should be a model instead of a proffessor. other than that the course is hard itself but she\'s clear on the course material. It\'s just that the exams are irrelevant to the lecutures..stuff she talks about in the lecture u\'ll never have to study for the test.
I was always bored
"He\'s an okay teacher, very funny and interesting. He tells stories atleast once a week that are unbelievable and entertaining. Homework is minimal but you should do it if you want to do well in the class. There are 5 tests and an optional final. I would recommend."
"If you are interesting in majoring in accounting and you take this guy, you will feel like switching your major."
"This class was just run ridiculously. We only accomplished 5% of what was on the syllabus, and only got one week to work on the final paper (we were supposed to have our topics approved before Thanksgiving break). That said, we watched some high quality films."
He was interesting and helpful. I\'d definitely take another class from him.
"AVOID!!!! The entire class is based upon your understanding of his fabricated opinions on history. I am studying to be a history teacher and I learned absolutly nothing!! If ur loud and outgoing and joke with him, then you\'ll get an easy A--if not then your in for it!! I REPEAT: AVOID!!!!!"
"She has no passion for the material, just reads slides given by the textbook with no insight or explanation. Yelled at students for doing poor on a midterm which she blatantly misled them on the testable material. Missed a few classes with no prior warning, then crammed chapters for the final at the end."
the best teacher i\'ve ever had
She really listens to the students but she expects a lot from them; although nothing unachievable. There is a lot of participation but not a lot of essays. She is always willing to work with students on deadlines. You have to go to class and talk but if you do that and about half the reading you will sail through.
This guy likes seltzer water. Opened my mind up to the possibilities of the universe.
"She\'s great in the lower level english classes, but don\'t take her for a independent study or use her for you mentor during senior seminar. If you choose a topic from her lecture, you\'ll be golden, if you think for yourself, watch out!"
She makes you work for your grades but creates a safe environment for students to learn and practice/apply skills learned in class. She was always quick to respond to my questions and concerns. Lots of examples to back up content in the text.
great teacher very helpful attend class and study easy A
"Where do I start? This man is extremely insensitive and an arrogant jerk. He tells these stupid stories, wastes all your time, then keeps you over the rehearsal time EVERY rehearsal. Aside from his personal ickiness, he sucks as a conductor. Bah! Don\'t take a class from him unless you have to!"
Dr. Pauley creates an outstanding learning experience!
"She is a very nice teacher who knows a lot about the subject and will give you as much help as you need, but man was she boring. I\'m usually a patient student, but wow, i couldn\'t wait to get out of her class. The class was easy, but the final paper was long, but she grades fairly and so it wasn\'t that big of a deal."
"Great professor, good person, very easy to talk to and ask for help about grades and help for classwork."
"I did not enjoy this class. Take anyone else that is available. This class was supposed to focus on scientific writing, but there were many irrelevant quizzes. Extremely picky. She SAYS she will help you, but she is never around."
"Just way too much work for 3cr.undergrad class, kind of difficult to see how info goes along with profession, have to print too many textbook pages for reading, I went thru an ink cartridge each week"
"As a talented artist, she is great at what she does. A very caring professor. However, if u think this is an easy A,u are kindly mistaken. U pretty much have to be great at drawing to get an A. Easy pass though. Class is expensive & requires lots of materials; HW &assignments take WAY TOO MUCH TIME. But u learn how to draw in the end. Inspirational"
"bad teacher, when we asked for help we were told told that she ""is not really available outside of class"". However, she\'s very easy, and doesn\'t even seem to care if you turn in all your assignments"
"She has poor listening skills, and I found it impossible to work with her. She told me I was doing well the entire semester, then dropped me with a D+ and told me that I should just retake her class."
"a good guy who gets that most of us don\'t really want to be there, but is enthusiastic anyway without going overboard. tries to brighten the class with corny jokes that you really can\'t help but laugh at. he gives weekly quizzes but they\'re a piece of cake as long as you pay attention in class and do the homework. i recommend him for a core course."
"Schneider is a great teacher... in the classroom. But outside of it, don\'t look for any help. He\'s more into himself and how others perceive him than sincerity."
"AKW is awesome. I absolutely loved her class. It is super easy, you show up take notes and leave. 3 test-easy if you study, and 2 papers, also easy. She usually let us out early and was always going off on tangents about her life and telling stories. It was great, never a dull moment.Take her class."
Best teacher I have ever had. Loved him and took two of his classes!
"He needs to clean up his appearance. He seems very angry and like he doesn\'t like teaching, talks sarcastic. Easy enough, just pay attention in class or read. Maybe someone should reach out and try to make a connection with him, he is an ajunct (staff)"
I took a really late night class and felt like he didn\'t want to be there which really made class go by slow. This professor would say what\'s on an exam and then you\'d get the test and it wasn\'t close to what he said. Had to reinforce my notes through online help since he is not available for extra help or office hours.
"Dr. Morton is funny and entertaining, but he tends to be very disorganized with some things. You will pass as long as you do all of the labs, and the TA is the best ever! You will basically get points just for effort! This class feels like there is a lot expected, but Dr. Morton makes things easy. Whatever you do, dont sweat out Micro I."
Mark is a very caring teacher and wants the best for everyone. His class has given me the tools necessary to be a success on this campus. I am able to share this information with students in other classes that are having a hard time. I know where to look for assistance with my work. Thanks Mark. You are awesome!
Brilliant man. Went to office for help often and spent time with him working problems; this is more than another prof was willing to do. Saved me in orgo. Would take any course given by him in a heartbeat. Med.school here I come!
"avoid if you can. seriously tough grader. you can be one of the best writers and still won\'t get an A in her class. had three 5-10 page papers, 20 min presentation, a midterm, and a final. she\'s a nice lady and funny at times, but you won\'t get the grade that you deserve."
Great professor. Easy class for any an easy passing grade if you do all the work. Exams are fairly easy. They are essay questions. Highly recommend him.
"She is passionate and caring about students and math. She is very helpful, but limited amount of time means get tutoringvisit her office hours if you have trouble understanding. Everyone learns differently so she tries hard to put things in terms that each person can understand. This can be more confusing to some when done during class time."
"Have had him 3 classes now and would take him for every class if I could. Wonderful teacher and a great guy. Everything on the tests comes from notes or videos/movies. Usually just 2 tests, all essays and possibly a paper or two, but nothing terrible."
"Leeanne is great, she is really funny and down to Earth! We had an amazing class and she had some great stories. She knows what she is talking about and will push you to do your best on all the skills and tests to ""form good habits early to take with you to nursing school"". TAKE THIS CLASS WITH HER IF YOU CAN!!!! Big time Columbus Crew Fan!!"
"Shaunna is a talker! She likes to go on and on about stuff or herself but doesn\'t seem to care what you have to say or share. Also, she seems like she would be a major micro-manager. Like eagle eyes watching people/nosey. But tough teacher, yet fair. Gives consideration in special circumstances."
"She loves what she does, I just don\'t think she\'s a good teacher. She expects you to already know everything before you show up to class, I learned more from my tutor and other students. DO NOT take her for lab. She grades ridiculously hard on lab."
makes learning fun; uses practical examples and relates material well.
"Bob, is a great professor. He is easy and very helpful. He grades easy and compromises with the students. NO quizes/exams. 2 projects (one resource notebook). Recomended."
"Mike really knows what he is talking about, he\'s totally smart. He\'s very patient with students and a very fare grader. The students that don\'t want to be graded hard complain, the rest of us do just fine."
She is nice but she has two fatal flaws: 1) gives way too much work. the journals are not needed and 2) the lolita debate got way out of control. These need 2 go.
"Awesome guy and the best professor to take for FIN 380, but it\'s a really hard subject so it\'s going to suck regardless."
"This is truly who you NEED to take a class with. He is an absolute scholar who could teach anywhere but chooses to be at Eckerd for the environment it offers. He is the master, the man, DOC G!"
By far Dr. C has been the best teacher I\'ve had here at ASU. He gives great lectures. He knows what he\'s talkin about but not in a boring way.
"Louis undertands what it takes to be a good teacher. Knowledge, compassion and dedication. He leads by example with the first two but lets his hunting and fishing get in the way of his teaching."
"He\'s a chaotic professor who doesn\'t seem to get his act together. Goes off topic in the lectures all the time. Gives barely any help on assignments, though his prompts are sometimes completely off topic considering the sources he gives us."
"I thought that this was a very interesting class. It is true that Prof. Homyk is a little hard to follow sometimes, but he is VERY knowledgeable about the subject. You have to do a lot of reading each week. The reading is valuable, because people should be educated about the enviornment, and if you do all the reading, you will ace the tests."
"If u are a real art student, will push you in the right direction and gets u prepared for the art world, makes you feel inspired and focused."
He is an easy teacher you just have to pay attention when he is lecturing & you have to communicate with him.Besides that an easy A/B.
she made this class very interesting with the lecture and the videos. not hard at all if you go to class and study.
He only gives two test: midterm and final. He gives you like 12 quizes and you also have to do like 10 homeworks. He test are killer! fill-in-the-blank. Have fun!!!
she is a good teacher. those that got kicked out made big errors
"Shes a great teacher. Very clear and explains exactly what she wants out of you. Study everything she tells you is one the quizzes, it is all there word for word. You dont have to read the book at all. Easy, fun class, but she keeps you the entire time, down to the second."
"It\'s more of a class for art majors. There\'s a lot of work for her class, but she explains everything thoroughly on how she wants her assignments to be submitted. Her lectures requires listening so you have to pay attention in class at all times. Daily vocab quizzes are simple but it can get annoying. The works are easy, but it\'s just so much."
"He\'s great and funny. Usually let\'s class out early. Assignments aren\'t too difficult, and the MGA was really fun!"
Another subjective grading class. Gives all A\'s because he is not a professor or a teacher. He is a dance instructor and doesn\'t know anything about teaching which is an insult because most of the students are PE teachers. Department really needs to hire more qualified PROFESSORS or at least someone who knows how to teach.
"Doesn\'t make use of powerpoint, it\'s all lecture with occasionally chalkboard use. But it\'s a fairly interesting class. There are section tests (that you mark yourself!) as well as a midterm/final. Text is expensive and he doesn\'t follow it closely, get a cheaper text."
"AWESOME TEACHER, FAIR, TOOK IN-PERSON, and super helpful ! Informative, punctual in emails, and made learning German (not an easy language at all) very fun ! I received a C+ in his class, but it\'s a lot of work. I\'m a full time student and worker. NOT an ""easy A"" so if this is what you\'re looking for, don\'t bother."
Online Greek Mythology class was an easy class if you\'ve taken Greek Mythology in high school. Easy grader. Three tests in the testing center that are 6 essay questions.
"Fantastic, helpful, kind, challenging, inspiring, and, in one of his favorite words: commendable! Lucky you to have this fabulous professor for chemistry."
Your grade is based on only labs and 3 tests: 2 midterms and a final. Lectures are three hours long and can be very boring. It seems like she has a lot of knowledge and knows what she\'s talking about but sometimes is hard to understand. If you can grasp sciences easy I say take this class but if you don\'t look for something else.
"Really great teacher and cares about students. He makes everything really clear and doesn\'t go too quickly. As long as you go to class and do the homework, it is an easy A"
"Parks is honestly the most incompetent professor I\'ve ever had. Although the class was super easy since Parks is a pushover and very lenient grader, Parks is a horrible professor. Parks would routinely mess up during lectures and spend 30-60 min trying to find and correct his mistakes. Don\'t feel like I\'ve even learned what discrete math is."
Liked it
Prof. Griego is dope!
"Such an amazing professor. Show up to class and you will pass the class as long as you take good notes. His quizzes are almost word for word what he lectures in class. Grade is based on weekly quizzes, midterm, and final. He\'s very passionate about what he teaches and it really shows!"
"Dr. Tucker really made this Gen Ed class enjoyable. He is really funny, and really cares about the students understanding. I went to office hours a few times and he\'s really patient with going back over things and making sure you learn. Not an ""easy"" A, but not hard either. I was always interested in the topics and enjoying what we were learning."
"If you are a history major, RUN. Prof caters ONLY to the law students in the class. Everything is geared towards law, rather than HISTORY. If It wanted to take Constitutional LAW I would have."
"Dr Edwards is awesome. She is pro student all the way. She really wants her students to succeed. Not gonna lie, tests are hard but not completely unreasonable. If you put in the work and get involved there\'s no way you won\'t pass this class. I consider Dr Edwards to be one of the best teachers on campus."
I would not recommend taking him unless you are a theatre major or minor. Theatre students will be more likely able to connect and find meaning and interest but he is rather difficult to get on with and grades oddly. Again. Do not take if not a major or minor.
Tannenwald\'s class was funny. Noone ever showed up to class. Usually there were 4 of us there on a given day bc attendance wasn\'t req & he never assigns hwk. Exams are copies of the study guide just w/ diff #\'s used. Final is also copy of previous tests. He definitely will confuse u and teach stuff you don\'t need but he means well. Easy A.
"She has written the lab manual, which many others have said. Her questions, are indeed, hard to decifer. I\'ve gotten almost a perfect score on every lab. The material is not hard for me, but this lady is so condescending and mean. She does not listen to your questions. I think she has issues."
"At the beginning of the class he told everyone that they were ""probably going to get a C in my class"" and, of course C\'s were given. He was very unprofessional."
"Very helpful, understanding, and clear professor. Tough midterm and final exams though she is a lenient grader (will curve if necessary). Each exam has 15 short-answer ques. & she asks for extremely specific info. Her review sheets help though. There is a 12pg research paper & paper presentation due at the end of the term & 5 (3pg) chap. summaries"
"hmm, what did I learn in world religions. Well, first I learned about different ways to build boats, then learned of the many different movies that are out there that have religion in them in one form or another. He doesnt teach, he rambles. Good Luck!"
I personally hated Jones because the entire class was one group project with somewhat confusing instructions. He has one lecture day with useless lectures. The other day he expects you to work with your group and doesn\'t even care if you come to class. You\'re not ever tested on the lectures but he does have attendance credit. No final.
"Mr. Tuller is very knowledgeable.There are three take home quizzes, 1 midterm and final (you can use a 3x5 card), 1 research paper, two assignments using primary sources, a discussion, and a presentation. There is also a lot of extra credit available. The book is only really needed for the writing assignments. The reading isn\'t really required."
By far the best visiting professor I\'ve had. Easy to understand when he spoke. He taught down-to-earth math without sacraficing theoretical rigor. Shame he\'s gone.
Very knowledgeable. Great class.
"Medical Terminology was pretty easy but sort of annoying. Not much to do other than one thing a week which would either be taking a exam, quiz, or emailing her just for weekly attendance. The exams and quizzes are timed and go by really quickly and are on lockdown browser."
He\'s chinese is really nice and the pronoucation is wonderful as a foreigner. The topic is interesting and he is good at teaching. Tests are not too hard. STUDY IT YOU WILL BE FINE
"I\'m a fan of history, and I found this course to be dry and unpleasant. Shelford takes herself and her subject matter far too seriously, especially for a gen ed. Also, asking students to print over 300 pages of online reading material is expensive, time consuming, and wasteful."
Take it and you\'ll love it :D
I recommend him
"Shes a nice lady, class is fun, and interesting. She knows her stuff, and is good at teaching it. The class itself is very indepth, so it might to much work just for fun. Some stuff is very demanding for an intro class, but its good for majors."
I do not recommend taking her class. It is very difficult finding out what she really wants from an assignment or why she graded something the way she did.
"She\'s trying to be funny every minute of her class, but it gets really annoying after a couple of weeks.Tests have nothing to do with her lectures.Read book, read each line, cuz she likes to test on really minor things.Useless class,u\'ll learn nothing."
He\'s hilarious--makes the class slightly less boring. Grades pretty easy. I wish he would teach all my spanish classes.
"I took my first year of German with Mrs Gardner. She was so easy to work with, and genuinely cares about her students success. Always provided constructive feedback to better you as a student. Even if you weren\'t even close, she would go step by step with you to make sure you understand."
"I didn\'t learn anything in her class, but its not because of her teaching. She is one incredibly beautiful woman. I wish she would be my personal tutor."
sometimes she is really funny i thinks she is good because she gives a lot of chances in the homework and in the attendance i think it is a good professor overall
"She is really sweet and has a layed back personality. You write three 3-4 page papers in her class (easy!)and you have quizzes on outside reason that are easy ways to bring up your grade. She grades really hard on grammar- so watch out. All-in-all I really enjoyed her class, I learned alot!"
Gives extra credit and is always willing to work with you. Tests are terminology only. A lot of memorization and a few papers on different areas of law which are really helpful. Absolutely enjoy all her classes because she\'s very caring and has a great sense of humor.
I wish I had this class before I took my SATs because I would have scored a lot higher in the vocabulary section. Professor\'s motto seems to be never use one syllable when four will do. I learned a lot in this class even some about history.
Shes Chinese & has a accent. Youre gonna need extra tutoring to pass her class.
Terrible Teacher. She is not a good teacher. If you want someone who will really help you don\'t take her class.
Professor Frausto is one of the best professor i had so far. i enjoyed class time and she was willing to help if we had a question even if it was in the middle of a lecture. very understanding.
"Prody is a very interesting person but not a good professor. Her lectures are scattered, she has no patience for students who don\'t understand a concept and she tests on material never taught. Her first exam in the class tested on material from a class that was not a required prerequisite for this course and if you had not taken it she did not care"
"This class was good and interesting if you read the book. If you read the book you\'ll understand the class, the only thing is that he doesn\'t have notes to copy off from he just lectures because you don\'t really know whats important or not."
Wouldn\'t recommend.
"His grading method stinks. His speeches stink even more. His time is always wrong but you are the one who gets the bad grade for it. you will think you got an A, but in reality you get a big fat F."
"Professor Spjute is an amazing teacher. I original took his class TA41 when I was just getting back into school. Got me out of my shell. Be prepared to meet new ppl in this class! Ez grader as long as you put some work in. Comfortable enviro if you\'re shy. Very supportive and helpful. Fun Class! Group(~6),Duo and Monologue major projects. Def Recom"
"Basically every week he gives you a sheet of notes all numbered through out the semester. Little to no note-taking. No homework. Doesn\'t take attendance at all. Allows a lot of senior observers in the class, if you don\'t know are elderly people who get to attend class for free and take no tests or do any work. He never ever gives work back on time"
"When it comes to simulation, this prof rocks."
he taught this class for the first time and he did an alright job. overall the class is fun but it does require some hard work and he doesnt give to many chances if u do bad on a test.
"Really fun class, se\xc3\xb1ora stewart is hilarious. I had taken spanish up to grade 11 so I took 100A as an easy elective and it was an awesome choice. showing up to class is really helpful and she is very clear about what is going to be on the tests. She is a hard marker in that you need to spell correctly and use accents properly but it was fair."
Great teacher learned alot.I have not taking math in 25 years and did well.Do homework and reveiws you we do well.
"Personally, I like the material he taught but I didn\'t care for the way he taught his class. He didn\'t make it too fun. Interactive, but not fun. If you prefer a class with more enthusiasm, I would request to have a new professor."
"Tom Stroik is a man who knows his stuff. He wasn\'t very approachable initially in class, however, upon meeting him one on one in his office hours, this changed immediately. He is very helpful, knowledgeable, and insightful. Always took time for students and became one of my favorites at UMKC. (Took his Structure English) p.s. STUDY!!!"
"Easy class, BAD PROFESSOR Luckily the TA is mainly in charge of grading and such. Repeats a bunch of crap in her lectures, but you don\'t have to go. You focus on practice problems then you would need definitions for the midterm/final! My grade was almost an F because her and my TA screwed up when I got a B. Find another if you can."
"About five graded speeches, not that hard, you get to choose the topics. Midterm was weird, make sure you go by his notes and not the book. His D2L could be a little more organized. Very strict but he\'s fair 80% of the time. One group speech at the end of the term."
"Worst professor I have ever had! Not at all helpful, makes simple things so much harder. Horrible instructions! Will not work with you. More like go figure it out yourself. Do not take him if u want to learn or maintain a GPA, or even pass. Out of 30 students enrolled, only 8 remained in his class till the end. Extremely rude!"
He was a really great lecturer and his class is extremely interesting. I advise anyone who wants an entry level bio class to take this!
"This class is mostly lectures. There are only 2 tests in the class, a midterm and a final. They are relatively easy as long as you understand the concepts behind the theories that he lectures on. The group project is moderate to hard, but overall it corresponds with what he teaches in class."
Funny guy with a British accent
"How to do well in Pfaelzer\'s class: Keep up with the reading, contribute to discussion once in a while, attend class (don\'t miss more than 2 or 3). If you are having trouble, talk to her. She is very helpful and truly cares about her students. She is opinionated, but she\'ll respect you if you use the texts to back up your opinions."
"this teacher is HARD! she thinks everyone has taken years of french before coming into her class, teaches classes all in french, will not help you if you have ANY type of problem, and grades hard. IF YOU NEVER TOOK FRENCH, dont take her. If you have taken french, then it might be fun for you, but very intensive."
"Professor Nadaff is a kind and charming woman who has a profound understanding about her subject. Her lectures can get a bit boring and dry sometimes but she tries her best to keep you engaged. She may come off as a little sassy and rude at the beginning but she\'s just bluffing, she\'s actually pretty great. Take her class! :)"
The class was very hard. The 4 question tests are also hard. He is an super nice guy but not very helpful.
too much papua new guinea talk. test not indicative of lectures. self-aware
He was a little weird and likes to pretend the drawings are talking... slightly crazy. Nice guy though. Make sure you at least get all the homework done before you have to turn in your portfolio to him.
Barb is a wonderful teacher! I have never felt confident in math and she did everything she could to help me. She was always willing to meet with me and go over things I didn\'t understand. I highly recommend her! She and a few other teachers collaborated and wrote a textbook to cut the cost for the students. Our textbook was only $15!! So awesome!!
"Honestly the best teacher at UOP, possibly the world!!!!"
good
Dr. McCue is a great professor. He really knows how to engage his students throughout his lectures. He teaches the subject very well. I would definitely recommend his Physiology course. This is honestly my favorite Bio class so far at STMU. You learn so much and he makes the course very engaging and interesting.
this man may very well have found a cure for insomnia. his quizzes cover to much information and make it hard to retain and study for any of his tests.
"Dr. Bernal is an awesome professor. He?s fair, funny, and passionate towards the material. Even if you do not like Spanish he makes it fun for you. He is cool and personable."
"Very well-structured teaching. Energetic and nice. Fair, but difficult tests."
"Class was more interesting the second half of the semester. Powers grades tough, but fair. Put the effort in and stay on top of the readings and your going to get a better grade than you would think."
"MGS 3100 - He must have changed a lot summer 16. He did take attendance. He was very sarcastic or had an attitude when a student asked a question or answered a question. His explanations are vague, if you cant learn on your own don\'t take his class."
"Dr Mehta is a great professor! He is fair and has a good soul. You have homework every week done on MyLab. You have some role-playing simulations that are time consuming and boring. Warm-up quizzes every week, taken on class. Exams are also online, taken in class. One group presentation, about a trend topic in Technology."
Nice guy. 4 tests and a final. Tests are hard as he gives out lots of handouts to study from and could be tested on anything. Labs and quizzes are not bad. I had him for a 3 hour and he rarely let us out early
She is the best and tries her best to deliver the materials. And she\'s so nice
How can an extra credit question be proper or fair to a multicultural class and what significance does it have with legal studies to ask the following question: how many rain deer has Santa Claus?During a lecture this teacher could not name the nine Supreme Court Justices and then two months later put that question in an exam. Grade:very arbitrary.
"One of the best professors I had so far. I\'ve never been very good at math, but the way he teaches his Finite Math class made it so easy to me. That was the first time EVER I made an A in a math class."
"Prof was great, nice guy and willing to answer questions. You don\'t hit all the info in class but if you read the book & do the study guide it\'s a easy A. The psych dept also give you 3 chances to take each test and provides tutors in the labs- use the resources they give you and you will do great!"
"He\'s awful!! He teaches Honors Crossroads, and DON\'T get him! His class is mind-numbing, he doesn\'t actually lead discussions or teach anything, if you want to learn anything at all don\'t get him! Your brian will rot!!!!!"
"While this class is very hard, It is also very helpful in life. I learned so much about our government I was never taught in high school. This class is important to take for school and for being a good citizen. He is a very nice teacher and he is very helpful if you ask for help. I took it online (first time too) so it was a challenge but worth it."
He is awesome. Show up and do what he tells you to do and you are sure to pass. This is the second time I take this class and I finally understand because if him. No regrets.
"Always comes in with a smile on her face, never EVER gets mad at anything that\'s going on! Seldom any homework, but when there is you should do it because they have high point value. If you know alot about computers already, don\'t take the intro class, because that\'s really what it is."
"He is a pretty good teacher especially compared to some of the teachers you could get for this class. He is okay at explaining things and the material can be confusing but he definitely tries to make it easy on the exams and the grading is really easy, you get points on the exams if you write something even if you didn\xe2\x80\x99t get the answer."
"Super nice & really straightforward. Tests are based off the PowerPoints, and those are posted online. No need to read the book. She always encourages dialogue, even if nobody is talking. Knowledgeable and active in the field, so she knows her stuff. Easygoing, likes to joke around, hip, and generally enjoyable."
I love this teacher! she is so nice and probably one of the best teachers you will ever have! she is very understanding of your personal problems and is an easy grader! if you don\'t take her for speech 100 you\'re an idiot!
"Fantastic class. A true college course; lots of studying and reading required. Fortunately, the study guides and assignments all tie back to the content taught, so nothing is ever a surprise. Willing to help. Unlike most teachers, Enloe demands respect and makes that perfectly clear in her intolerance for tardiness or disrespectful chatterboxes."
mrs. stock is super cool and fun. very cute and animated. i promise you will love her. she teaches very clearly and makes class interesting and enjoyable. she is so helpful. not too hard on the eyes either. highly recommended.
"I came into this class hopeful and excited because my Dad is a CFO but was not impressed with his teaching style. Very full of himself, always talks about how great of an accountant he is, yet I don\'t believe he has ever been at a top fortune 500 company at any prominent level. Always brags about his family life to the point of being annoying"
"One of the best professors I\'ve ever had. Compelling lectures and interesting content, but he can also come off as being a little abrasive. If you\'re even a little interested in philosophy I highly recommend."
"Zirino is a great guy with lots of experience. Don\'t take this class. He\'s not good at explaining things and is fairly disorganized. Tests not always on what we\'ve learned. Hard to pay attention to. It\'s not a hard class (esp. with lab bringing up your grade), but it\'s not a good one. Surely not the worst class you could take, but I\'d avoid it."
"Frank Brown is a boss. No need for the book as he gives you all the info via Power Point slides. The subjects hard but he does a good job at explaining it. If you get in his 400 to 500 person class, you\'ll have a total of 3 exams and that is it. And the final is non-cumulative"
Will test you on obscure things. What did I say at 10:30 on Mar. 15?
Entertaining and really nice.
The lectures may not have been the greatest but the tests were pretty easy and she did a good job with answering questions.
His New hair dew is da bomb. He is trying to get into the 21st century. He rubs his face alot when he is upset. Good Teacher.
"Contracts is great with Joe D. He has a different teaching style, and you might not understand what\'s going on till Nov. but you learn in th end."
"has a very sarcastic personality, that many times will make you think ""i can\'t believe he just said that out loud!"".. he is funny though.. enjoyable class,and very easy"
"VERY unclear when it comes to assignments,homework ,essays and everything else. No one in the class knew what she expected of us and she often would tell us one thing and turn around the next class and say something completely different. She is very caring though and other than her being extremely confusing and hard to understand shes okay"
"this guy is a horrible teacher. You cannot understand him at all he does not teach you spanish he just gets up yelling and screaming things you cannot understand. Tests are impossible, i am a senior and might not graduate because of this idiot."
"Great professor, nice, clear and fun explanation. Sample tests, goes over the problem hundred times. Highly recommended"
"She let\'s you record lectures which helps because she expects the answers on the handwritten exam to be word for word. If you record the lectures, do the essay and go to every class you should get an A no problem. I sent her emails I never received a response to so don\'t bother contacting her that way. Do not buy the book. Did not use it once."
"Professor Waddell is very kind and understanding instructor. He loves what he teaches and offers his own life experiences to help us better understand difficult topics. He doesn\'t give a final exam or exams. But he did assign two 8-page research papers. I would recommend him if you are willing to put in the effort in his class, I really enjoyed it."
"He is really the nicest professor I\'ve ever had! His lecture is not that interesting, but nothing is interesting when you have to memorize A LOT of materials for the exams. Biochem I was like hell, biochem II is much better already. Sir Hans Kornberg is 87 so he doesn\'t talk very loud. But anything you didn\'t understand in class just go to his OH."
"When is this prof going to retire? Absolutely TERRIBLE! can\'t speak English, doesn\'t know subject matter, yells a lot. A complete waste!"
"He\'s an incredibly nice man, but difficult to understand and the tests cover nothing that was taught in class. More than half the class dropped out, and only half of what was left actually passed, and barely at that.\r \r Eastfield is an easy joke, but this class is difficult just because he\'s confusing/confused."
"Really funny lady, and I am amazed at how much I improved with my writing in her class. SHe is always available for help, I wish she was PR, so I can take more classes with her!"
Mr Thomas is the best!! Pick his class and pick a winner!!
"Class was fairly easy and straight-forward, not many assignments, but this may have been due to taking an 8-week course. No textbook, just reading and testing on the novel Kite Runner. Extra credit was available for the class, and Kitty was willing to work with students to edit papers and accepted rewrites until the last day of class."
Great instructor. Friendly personality and easy material.
"Prof. is okay, try to make it interesting and most students pass even if they hand in late projects and screw up on exams, alot of students from my class did good and they suk up alot , which i thinks he likes.. so Suk up and try to try lol..."
She\'s very helpful and easy to talk to. I\'ve taken 2 of her classes and they\'ve both been great. She\'s laid back but does expect you to work.
"A good professor, with lots of potential"
"Aleman is really a genius, he may be one of the smartest profs in the whole department. Great guy, not out to get you and the readings and lectures are actually fairly interesting. Still, it\'s an economics class which means it\'s not going to be the most exciting class on the schedule. Great teacher though, I hope I can take his class again."
"Dr. West is a great teacher, and a sweet lady, but I didn\'t always feel that I could open up to her. Not that she would opening condemn me, but that she wouldn\'t really understand where I was coming from. However, that doesn\'t take away from the fact that I was able to learn from her."
very sweet teacher. loves english to a fault. essays are not hard. daily work is not hard either. there are a lot of handouts though. there are also two grammar test and a large vocab test.
"This guy is great honestly! He is sort of hard to understand and the class can drag on but he always gives a 10 minute break. Show up to class, with 2 freebies. He has a great sense of humor and is really witty makes class more fun. I just did all my assignments, journal, presentation and paper, failed the final and got a B+. Very easy to pass."
Hard to understand but repeats what he says a lot and also writes what he says on the board. He has bad handwriting but if you listen to what he says you will get it. His tests are pretty easy other than the grammar mistakes. The book is helpful at times and he knows what he is talking about. I loved the class.
Owen is a really fun guy. Just make sure you keep up with your homework and STUDY for the tests and you will be in good shape.
"She is a great teacher and extremely helpful! Unlike the other person who wrote on here i actually love taking classes from Kara. She has been a wonderful teacher and a mentor. She cares about her students and tries to make sure that everyone succeeds not only in her class, but in life as well."
"Katen is one of the best Professor i have taken at HCC, he is extremely helpful and teach things that you can take into real life in the business world. His tests are based on power point lectures, which you have access to them outside of class. If you study the Power Point slides you will pass. You can also study abroad for this course!!."
Dr. Ewing is a nice lady but she certainly won\'t spoon-feed you the material. She is very lecture heavy so be ready to take down lots of notes. She gives plenty of examples on the board & is happy to answer questions. JUST ASK! Lots of quizzes but half of them get dropped. The quizzes prepare you for her exams. Do the work & you\'ll be good.
Took her class online and it was a breeze.. just keep up with the reading and reflection logs! Great instructor!
"Funniest Professor I have ever had, and I\'ve had all the other ones that have that reputation at MLaw"
I don\'t know what I recieved as a grade for this class so I won\'t be biased saying this-- this class was REALLY interesting and engaging. The reading wasnt even a lot and was definitely worth it. She\'s a great professor.
"Good note taking skills a MUST for first test. Has 3 tests, tests 2 and 3 straight from book. GO TO CLASS FOR 1st TEST NOTES! Offers extra credit test, READ THE BOOK! TESTS ARE VERY DIFFICULT! STUDY STUDY STUDY! On his tests you can\'t memorize, you have to grasp the concept. Tough class."
This class is by far the easiest class I have taken in college! Just do what she ask in the assignments and you will get an easy A!
he is a really nice guy and works with you on your grade. he lets the class decide when to take quizzes and test and gives some extra credit. as a freshmen i recommend taking him so you can ease into college level work. don\'t worry about this teacher your in good hands!
"Papkov was really helpful in class and was clear when explaining things. We never had a test during the semester but we had at least one quiz pretty much every week. As long as you go to class, pay attention, and actually try to understand, you\'ll do fine. The only thing that irritated me was that he would sometimes talk to us like we were children"
Very nice guy cares about his students and teaches in a visual way to make you understand math.
"I took his class in Spring 2009. Excellent teacher, really nice, fair, and knows his stuff. It was one of the best linguistics classes I took."
"I had Bill for his first year at Acadia - he was a wonderful breath of ""reality"" in the theatre department. You can learn a lot from him and he\'s great to work with."
Hellish course but with Dr. Ritchie it morphed into something useful and even fun!
He is a very funny and nice teacher. He loves what he is doing and wants everyone to enjoy his class. He lets you keep your old exams and they are very similar to the new tests. Definitly would recommend this teacher!!
